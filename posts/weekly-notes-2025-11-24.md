Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord fans finally get their hands on naval warfare with the game's first DLC. Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE brings the beloved Korean web novel series to Steam.

Let's dive in!

## Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE by Netmarble Neo

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "154913"
}
```

A multiplayer action RPG based on the korean web novel series [Solo Leveling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_Leveling).
Players appreciate the combat mechanics along with the graphics quality and visual presentation.

The story adaptation receives praise from fans, and players appreciate the character progression system for its depth and variety. 
However, the biggest complaint is the always-online requirement that frustrates players who want to play solo. The Co-op experience also gets significant criticism in the reviews.

Korean and Chinese players gives the game notably lower rating compared to the global audience

## Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails by TaleWorlds Entertainment

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "194035"
}
```

After waiting for a long time, fans finally get to lay their hands on the first DLC of [Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/120340/mount_blade_ii_bannerlord). The DLC introduces naval warfare and commanding fleets.
However, the DLC launches only at 53% Mixed reviews. The overwhelming critique is regarding technical issues with bugs, crashes, and performance problems.

Players debate the value of the DLC compared to its cost and content, but a lot of players seems to see the potential in it with hopes that the bugs and issues will be ironed out over time.

## Of Ash and Steel by Fire & Frost

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "44206"
}
```

An action RPG set in a dark fantasy world published by [tinyBuild](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/search?query=publisher:tinyBuild). 
Marketed as an "RPG created by a passionate team that values the essence of classic old-school RPGs and modern design" on the store page - which I do personally like the sound of.

The game launched with Mixed reviews though. Quest progression issues are the top complaint with frequent encounters with broken quests and unclear directions. Second largest complaint is about technical issues including crashes and graphical glitches.

However, players appreciate the exploration aspect and the design of the game world. The game offers a substantial amount of content and playtime, which is generally very appreciated.

## Project Motor Racing by Straight4Studios & Giants Software

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "202361"
}
```

A racing simulation game [from the makers of Farming Simulator](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/search?query=developer:Giants%20Software) that launched with an incredibly low rating of only ~30% positive.

AI behavior issues are the top complaint. Reportedly, the AI lacks awareness and often behaves erratically, leading to a lot of frustration. Graphics quality receives heavy criticism for being not nearly as good compared to other racing titles.
Force feedback issues make the driving experience inconsistent. In general, it seems like players complain about game feel, which I would think is vitally important in a game like this.
Performance stability problems including crashes, lag, and poor optimization affect gameplay also seem to be a major complaint.

## BLACK SOULS II by Eeny, meeny, miny, moe?

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "225120"
}
```

A dark fantasy RPG inspired by Alice in Wonderland. The second game in the series started only earlier this year with [BLACK SOULS](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/210086/black_souls).

Impressive to release a second game (and have both games selling well!), just a couple of months after each other. I assume the tools & the workflow is quite optimized.

In this game players engage in tactical turn-based combat while exploring a mad world. They express a strong desire to find Alice throughout the game. The intricate story and world-building receive frequent praise for depth and emotional impact.
Character development is appreciated, particularly the emotional connections to characters.

However, the game seems to require a patch to access full content, which several reviews mention as a significant issue with the initial release

## Constance by btf

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "91777"
}
```

A hand-drawn 2D action-adventure metroidvania. Players consistently praise the beautiful art style and animation quality. Players report that game feel in movement and combat are smooth, enjoyable, and rewarding.

Game length and content disappoint many. This site estimates the playtime to be around 9 hours. 
It's a complex issue, but often when I see criticism about game length I wonder if that could have been prevented with just obviously stating it on the store page - to really manage expectations. 
Because I guess most players expect a certain game length when it comes to this genre. (e.g. [Hollow Knight: Silksong](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/39445/hollow_knight_silksong) seems to take around 40 hours to complete)

Anyway, exploration and map design also get mixed feedback - some find it enjoyable while others feel it lacks depth and guidance.

But the emotional impact resonates with players through themes of personal struggle and emotional depth along with a soundtrack that enhances the overall experience.
