This week brought a mix of controversy and nostalgia to Steam.

The Bazaar launched with strong gameplay but faced criticism over monetization and developer responses to feedback. Meanwhile, OFF finally got its official Steam release after 17 years as a cult classic, proving some games are worth the wait.

Dawn of War joined the growing list of "definitive editions", while smaller titles like Abyssus showed that polish at launch still matters.

## The Bazaar by Tempo
***Largest audiences**: ~75% English, ~7% Chinese (Simplified)*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "222391"
}
```

A hero-building strategy game set in a vibrant galactic marketplace - and it's finding its audience despite some growing pains. 

Players love the addictive gameplay. The visuals and art style get consistent praise, along with the strategic depth and character variety that keeps builds fresh. Just by looking at the screenshots, it gives off strong Hearthstone vibes.

But monetization issues dominate the negative feedback. Players express dissatisfaction with the pricing model and additional content costs as well as how the developers responded to this feedback. They've faced [accusations of silencing critics on their social media channels](https://www.thegamer.com/the-bazaar-steam-launch-censorship-accusations-silencing-criticism/).

## Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition by Relic Entertainment
***Largest audiences**: ~59% English, ~20% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "206118"
}
```

Like many other strategy games, it's time for Dawn of War to get it's definitive treatment.

Players appreciate the nostalgia factor and visual upgrades that enhance the overall experience. The core gameplay remains engaging and fun, reminiscent of the original while benefiting from some enhancements.

However, significant concerns dominate the feedback. Technical issues including bugs, crashes, and performance problems frustrate players. Pathfinding issues affect gameplay, particularly in single-player modes. Many feel disappointed by the lack of mod support and consider the price too high.

## Black Souls by Eeny, meeny, miny, moe?
***Largest audiences**: ~41% Chinese (Simplified), ~30% English, ~12% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "210086"
}
```

A dark fantasy open-world game where you play as a nameless undead in a misty kingdom - similar to another popular game we all know about.

Players praise the gameplay mechanics reminiscent of Souls-like games, along with engaging narrative and character development. The humor and fun aspects get mentioned frequently, creating a lighter experience despite the dark themes. 

However, the game seems to require an initial patch for the complete experience, and many emphasize this necessity in reviews. Audio issues and game accessibility problems also surface in feedback.

## Abyssus by DoubleMoose Games
***Largest audiences**: ~72% English, ~9% Russian, ~8% Chinese (Simplified)*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "125493"
}
```

A fast-paced multiplayer shooter set in a brine-powered underwater world - made here in Sweden in Skövde not too far from where I am.

Players find the gameplay enjoyable and engaging, often describing it as addictive. The unique weapons and great aesthetic get frequent praise, along with strong multiplayer experiences when played with friends.
Players express desire for additional content variety to enhance longevity as well.

The interesting thing here is that the game is recognized for being well-polished at launch with minimal bugs AND some complain about technical issues. I suspect that might be from two different audiences with the audience anomaly in Chinese Simplified reviews - giving the game a lower score there (around 60%, where the global average is 84%).

## OFF by Mortis Ghost & Fangamer
***Largest audiences**: ~80% English, ~5% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "182363"
}
```

A surreal indie adventure RPG that's getting its official Steam debut - 17 years after its original 2008 release.

Originally made in RPG Maker, gained its following through fan translations and word-of-mouth. Players praise the improved gameplay mechanics, new content, visual improvements, and the strong nostalgia factor for those returning to it.

The new soundtrack draws mixed reactions - some enjoy it while others miss the original. Translation issues and atmosphere concerns also surface, though these seem minor compared to the overall positive reception.

Might be a good time to release this game now, just after the release of DELTARUNE. The fact that it inspired games like Undertale and maintained a passionate fanbase for almost two decades speaks to its lasting impact on indie gaming.

## ⚔️ Early Access Graduates

* [Deadzone: Rogue](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/148680/deadzone_rogue) - A rogue-lite shooter set aboard a spaceship. Had a very short early access period, I covered it back in [end of April](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/blog/weekly-notes-2025-04-28). Generally liked for its addictive gameplay and the satisfying gunplay. Lately it's been getting 80+ positive reviews, but with an interesting anomaly where Chinese Simplified would only give the game about 50%.
* [Relic Hunters Legend](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/183629/relic_hunters_legend) - A co-op looter shooter action RPG. A mixed rating overall, but just looking at the last 6 months they've been getting scores in the high eighties - which indicates a significant improvement during early access. Players enjoy the engaging gameplay, art style & fun multiplayer experience - they dislike the grindy progression, basic combat mechanics and the childish tone.

## Notable Mentions
