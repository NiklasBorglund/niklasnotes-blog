This was a week filled with remakes and remasters, and KONAMI's Metal Gear Solid Δ leading the charge while Gears of War: Reloaded stumbles over missing co-op features. 

Also, the regional reception gaps continue to tell interesting stories - particularly with Shinobi from SEGA showing a massive 27-point difference between Chinese and English audiences.

Let's dive in!

## METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER by KONAMI
***Largest audiences**: ~63% English, ~8% Russian, ~5% Spanish*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "117097"
}
```

The only game in the series I've personally played is the first one on Playstation 1 - but 20 years after it was released. 
My brother, a long time fan, decided to show it to me and really get me to realize the greatness of the series. Good memories. And whenever I now see a MGS game, I get intrigued.

This time around, KONAMI has released a remake of [METAL GEAR SOLID 3: SNAKE EATER](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/64116/metal_gear_solid_3_snake_eater_master_collection_version).

Players praise the faithful remake and the upgraded graphics. They love going back to play as Snake during the Cold War and to feel nostalgia over this game. However, a lot of players complain about performance and technical issues. 
Some also complain about the high pricing and that the mechanics feel somewhat outdated compared to newer games.

Generally very positive across all the audience, but with an anomaly with the Simplified Chinese crowd - where performance issues seem to be the main issue.

## Gears of War: Reloaded by The Coalition
***Largest audiences**: ~78% English, ~5% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "203173"
}
```

Landing globally on just 54% after its first week, the re-release of this old gem got a rocky start.

Players like the updated graphics and experience a lot of nostalgia. It still holds up.

But the big let down is regarding it's multiplayer. Particularly the local split screen co-op. Players feel like the developers advertised the game that this feature would exist, but it does not.
You can play the game with a friend in split screen, but only in the console versions. It's nowhere to be found in the Steam version.

In a game that practically helped define modern co-op experiences, it might not have been the best decision to cut it for people wanting to relive the same nostalgia.
My guess is that they will fix this eventually, but we'll just have to wait and see.

## Whisper of the House by 元气弹工作室(GD Studio)
***Largest audiences**: ~57% Chinese (Simplified), ~32% English*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "72466"
}
```

A cozy simulation game where players act as a housekeeper in Whisper Town, engaging in tasks like organizing and decorating spaces while uncovering stories and secrets.

Players appreciate the game's relaxing and cozy atmosphere, making it a perfect escape from stress. The addictive gameplay loop keeps players engaged, often losing track of time while organizing and decorating.

However, some players feel the game lacks sufficient content, leading to concerns about replayability. Bug issues hinder gameplay for some, and translation problems impact accessibility for non-Chinese speakers. A few mention the gameplay can become repetitive in later stages.

## STORY OF SEASONS: Grand Bazaar by Marvelous Inc.
***Largest audiences**: ~38% English, ~37% Chinese (Simplified), ~9% Chinese (Traditional), ~6% Japanese*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "195987"
}
```

A remake of the 2008 Nintendo DS farming sim - originally released as Harvest Moon DS: Grand Bazaar before the series name change. Players revive a failing bazaar by raising animals and selling goods to restore the town's former glory.

Players praise the charming graphics, nostalgic gameplay loop, and the unique bazaar mechanic that differentiates this entry. Voice acting and quality of life improvements enhance the experience for returning fans.

However, technical issues frustrate some, with crashes and performance problems reported. Some players also criticize the rushed gameplay pacing with hectic short days, and excessive cutscenes that interrupt flow.

## SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance by SEGA & Lizardcube
***Largest audiences**: ~46% Chinese (Simplified), ~33% English*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "170902"
}
```

A 2D action platformer where players control Joe Musashi on his quest for vengeance after his village is destroyed.
Players praise the beautiful art and animation, fluid gameplay mechanics, and engaging combat system that rewards skillful play.

Frustrating jumping mechanics plague many players' experiences, with complaints about tedious and poorly designed platforming sections. The story lacks depth, difficulty balance issues make certain sections too easy while others feel unfair, and some criticize the repetitive level design particularly in chase sequences.
The divide between the two major audiences tells an interesting story - Chinese players rate it 65% positive, while English speakers give it 92%. 

The jumping mechanics appear to be the dividing factor, where the Simplified Chinese audience describes them as tedious and poorly designed. Not sure exactly why, but it's something definitely worth investigating more.
