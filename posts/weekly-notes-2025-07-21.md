This week's biggest releases had a rough landing due to technical issues.

WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers and Killing Floor 3 both struggled with performance problems that dominated player feedback. Meanwhile, smaller releases like The King is Watching and Mage Arena found their audiences by focusing on solid, if simpler, execution.

## WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers by Leenzee
***Largest audiences**: ~89% Chinese(Simplified), ~6% English*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "105712"
}
```

This week’s most high-profile release is also the most controversial.
As a direct contender to the massively popular [Black Myth: Wukong](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/16273/black_myth_wukong) it looked promising with it's not too shabby score of [75% on Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/wuchang-fallen-feathers/).

But on Steam? It’s a different story entirely.
With almost 60,000 reviews, the game sits at just 36% positive - and only 33% among Simplified Chinese reviews. For comparison, English-language reviews sit closer to 70%, but they make up a small slice of the pie.

Performance issues are the top complaint, followed by frustration over deluxe edition buyers getting less than standard buyers due to a rewards mix-up.

I looked into some of the top upvoted reviews specifically and some players also criticize the game’s use of Chinese history, calling it disrespectful or tone-deaf.
It’s safe to say the backlash runs deeper than just frame drops.

## Killing Floor 3 by Tripwire Interactive
***Largest audiences**: ~53% English, ~15% Russian, ~11% Chinese(Simplified)*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "120844"
}
```

The third entry in the Killing Floor series dropped this week to a lukewarm reception.

Fans still enjoy the core mechanics and weapon customization, and despite the issues, many say it's still fun.

But like WUCHANG, performance problems dominate the complaints. Crashes, stuttering, and inconsistent framerate are common. Some players also feel the game lacks content compared to its predecessors.

All audiences gave it mixed reviews, but the Simplified Chinese score is especially low at 34%. Top reviews from that region echo the same frustrations but with a sharper tone.

I've seen this pattern a lot now. If you're targeting the Chinese audience, performance problems will hit your score harder than elsewhere. Something to keep in mind.

## The King is Watching by Hypnohead
***Largest audiences**: ~44% Chinese(Simplified), ~33% English, ~8% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "126790"
}
```

The King is Watching is a kingdom management roguelike where your gaze literally controls productivity - stare at your workers and they work harder, look away and things fall apart.

Players are hooked on the addictive gameplay and unique mechanics. The pixel art style gets consistent praise, and there's enough variety to keep runs fresh.

Main complaints center on the lack of a save feature (ouch for a ~13-hour game) and some crashes. But unlike this week's bigger releases, these feel like fixable problems rather than fundamental design flaws.

## Mage Arena by jrsjams
***Largest audiences**: ~78% English, ~6% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "203886"
}
```

In Mage Arena - players cast spells by actually speaking incantations, which creates some genuinely magical moments when it works. The community loves the unique concept and the potential for growth.

The issues are predictable - voice recognition can be spotty, and some players want more spells and content variety. A few mention community behavior problems, which always seems to plague competitive multiplayer games.

At 3 hours estimated playtime, it seems to be more of a "try this wild thing" experience than a long-term commitment. But sometimes that's exactly what you want.

## Wildgate by Moonshot Games
***Largest audiences**: ~83% English*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "195393"
}
```

A space battle royale with extraction shooter elements.

Players love the team-based mechanics and creative combat, especially the ship-to-ship battles. The visuals get consistent praise, and many appreciate that it feels reasonably priced for what it offers.

The problems are classic multiplayer growing pains: microtransactions frustrate players, server issues create lag, and there's a steep learning curve for newcomers.

## s.p.l.i.t by Mike Klubnika
***Largest audiences**: ~76% English, ~15% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "202826"
}
```

A atmospheric horror experience focused on terminal hacking and malware attacks.

Players love the tense atmosphere, standout soundtrack, and innovative concept. The developer Mike Klubnika gets recognition for creating experiences that feel genuinely unsettling.

The main complaints center on length and confusion. At around 1.5 hours, many players want more content, and some find the terminal commands and gameplay mechanics confusing rather than immersive.
