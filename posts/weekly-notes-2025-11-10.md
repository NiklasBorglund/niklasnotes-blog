Escape from Tarkov's long-awaited Steam launch hit severe technical problems, while Call of Duty struggles with campaign design choices. 
Where Winds Meet brings beautiful tenth-century China, and Anno 117 impresses visually.

Let's dive in!

---

## Where Winds Meet by Everstone Studio

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "197637"
}
```

An open-world action RPG set in tenth-century China. Players praise the stunning visuals and beautiful environments that bring the historical setting to life.

The combat mechanics receive strong praise for being engaging and enjoyable, though some mention minor control issues. Exploration stands out as a highlight, with players appreciating the world design and environmental variety.

However, localization problems significantly hurt the experience. Particularly the lack of Russian and Brazilian Portuguese language support, both which are currently in the top 3 audiences looking at the audience breakdown.
The time-gating mechanics frustrate players who feel restricted in character progression and many also feel like the co-op features are limited.

## Anno 117: Pax Romana by Ubisoft Mainz

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "50650"
}
```

The latest Anno entry moves the series to the Roman Empire. Players appreciate the core gameplay mechanics, including city-building and management features that feel engaging.

Players love the graphics - and I have to say I agree. It looks amazing.

However, the Ubisoft Connect launcher frustrates many players who see it as unnecessary when already purchasing it through steam. Performance issues including FPS drops and optimization problems are widely mentioned.

The campaign structure itself disappoints with a feeling of it being incomplete. 
Also, AI-generated artwork draws significant criticism from some players. They feel like it's not worthy of a premium priced game.

## INAZUMA ELEVEN: Victory Road by LEVEL5 Inc.

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "51093"
}
```
A football-themed RPG where nostalgia drives much of the positive sentiment. Players appreciate [returning to the series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inazuma_Eleven) with fond memories of previous games and the anime.
The story mode receives praise for engaging characters and well-developed plotlines. Players enjoy the Chronicle Mode, which lets them relive stories from previous games in the series.

The gacha system is appreciated for allowing character unlocking and at the same time being free - it doesn't cost anything to use apparently.

However, technical issues including bugs and matchmaking problems affect the gameplay experience. UI/UX problems frustrate players, particularly around team management and equipment changes.

## Escape from Tarkov by Battlestate Games

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "230942"
}
```

Escape from Tarkov finally released on steam with their 1.0 release. Despite technical issues, some players find the gameplay experience rewarding and addictive, highlighting its unique mechanics.

However, the launch has been severely problematic. Server overload issues prevent many players from logging in, especially during the launch period. Account creation problems due to server maintenance and login issues block access to the game.

Performance issues including low FPS and crashes affect the gameplay experience. Cheating and unfair gameplay mechanics frustrate players and impact their overall experience.

Launching at only 31% positive, it will be interesting to see if they can bounce back from this.

## Call of Duty®: Black Ops 7 by Raven Software, Sledgehammer Games, Treyarch, Infinity Ward, Beenox, High Moon Studios, Activision Shanghai, Demonware

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "209908"
}
```

The latest Black Ops entry launches with mixed reviews.  The campaign design draws heavy criticism for lacking checkpoints, requiring online play, and having a co-op only structure that detracts from the single-player experience.
Multiplayer experiences suffer reportedly from poor matchmaking, server issues, and unbalanced gameplay.

The Zombies mode gets mixed feedback - some enjoy the content while others find it lacking compared to previous games, citing changes that detract from the experience they are used to in CoD.

Many players feel the game is overpriced for the content provided (at 79.99 euro).

## Rue Valley by Emotion Spark Studio

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "76959"
}
```

A time-loop RPG published by [Owlcat Games](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/search?query=developer:Owlcat%20Games). Players are highly engaged with the narrative depth and intricate storytelling, often comparing it to [Disco Elysium](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/138583/disco_elysium_the_final_cut).
Gameplay mechanics, particularly the time loop and exploration elements, are well-received.

Voice acting quality gets mixed feedback - as well as some players experience technical issues. The character personality system receives criticism for its simplicity and lack of depth.

Personally I'm intrigued, even though it got mixed reviews. Playing Disco Elysium a few years ago left me wanting more - so this one is going on my wishlist.

## Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Mysteria Ecclesiae by Warhorse Studio

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "238274"
}
```

The third and final story DLC for Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. Some players appreciate the atmospheric design and graphics of the new monastery location.

However, the DLC faces significant criticism. Many feel it's too short, lacking substantial content and depth for a paid expansion. The forced stealth mechanics frustrate players who find them tedious and poorly implemented.
The storyline receives complaints for being predictable and lacking engaging twists.

## Early Access Graduates

* [Salt 2: Shores of Gold](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/82907/salt_2_shores_of_gold) - An open world pirate game. Players love exploring island and the many quests you can discover along with the crafting and looting system. Players dislike the lack of a ship combat feature, which many would expect from a pirate game. Some players also report technical and performance issues that causes crashes and freezing during gameplay.
