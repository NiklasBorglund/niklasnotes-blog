## Where Winds Meet by Everstone Studio

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "197637"
}
```

An open-world action RPG set in tenth-century China. Players praise the stunning visuals and beautiful environments that bring the historical setting to life.

The combat mechanics receive strong praise for being engaging and enjoyable, though some mention minor control issues. Exploration stands out as a highlight, with players appreciating the world design and environmental variety.

However, localization problems significantly hurt the experience. Particularly the lack of Russian and Brazilian Portuguese language support, both which are currently in the top 3 audiences looking at the audience breakdown.
The time-gating mechanics frustrate players who feel restricted in character progression and many also feel like the co-op features are limited.

## Anno 117: Pax Romana by Ubisoft Mainz

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "50650"
}
```

The latest Anno entry moves the series to the Roman Empire. Players appreciate the core gameplay mechanics, including city-building and management features that feel engaging.

Players love the graphics - and I have to say I agree. It looks amazing.

However, the Ubisoft Connect launcher frustrates many players who see it as unnecessary when already purchasing it through steam. Performance issues including FPS drops and optimization problems are widely mentioned.

The campaign structure itself disappoints with a feeling of it being incomplete. 
Also, AI-generated artwork draws significant criticism from some players. They feel like it's not worthy of a premium priced game.
