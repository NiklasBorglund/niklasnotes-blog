Hello everyone!

We’ve got a packed week: a PS5 port that people love on Steam, a Five Nights at Freddy's spinoff sparking debate, and a philosophical survival game full of clones. There’s also a controversial launch, a nostalgic WW2 throwback, and some Steam Next Fest demos that got picked up by my server.

Dune: Awakening technically launched this week - but since I already covered it in last week’s post, I won’t repeat myself. You can find that write-up [HERE](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/blog/weekly-notes-2025-06-02).

## Stellar Blade™ by SHIFT UP Corporation

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "173476"
}
```

Originally a PS5 exclusive, Stellar Blade just launched on Steam - and it's already at 94% Very Positive with over 20,000 reviews.
Players praise its fluid combat, stunning visuals, and strong performance, with many calling it a showcase piece. The character design (especially EVE) is a frequent highlight.

Criticism is minor: some mention sluggish movement, technical issues, and mixed feelings about the puzzles.

## Five Nights at Freddy's: Secret of the Mimic by Steel Wool Studios

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "193371"
}
```

The newest Five Nights at Freddy's entry leans into stealth, atmosphere, and multiple endings - something that’s resonating with fans but dividing others.

Players appreciate the gameplay variety, visuals, and overall atmosphere. Bugs, glitches, and story complexity are common pain points, and some feel the price doesn’t match the content.

## The Alters by 11 bit studios

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "11629"
}
```

The Polish team behind [Frostpunk](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/145889/frostpunk) and [This War of Mine](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/24018/this_war_of_mine) returns with something different - a sci-fi survival story about Jan Dolski crashing on an alien planet and cloning alternate versions of himself to stay alive.

Players are responding well to the story, gameplay concept and is generally very well received. The main complaints are about clunky controls, limited character customization, and bugs.

## MindsEye by Build A Rocket Boy

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "26807"
}
```

Single-player action-adventure thriller set in a dystopian desert city published by IO Interactive at a premium €59.99 price tag. At the time of writing, it’s sitting at a surprisingly low 38% positive rating.
There’s been a lot of writing about the game - and the backlash. The co-CEO even suggested that the [negative reviews were paid for](https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio) - something their publisher [seems to disagree about](https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-publisher-doesnt-believe-negative-comments-were-paid-for-despite-developer-suggesting-otherwise).

So what do the reviews say? A majority of reviews mention performance issues & bugs, which sadly seems to become more and more common with AAA releases.
Among the positives we see that players like the engaging story, and it's potential if the technical issues get addressed.

## Heroes of Valor by Fancy Cat Interactive

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "163293"
}
```

Heroes of Valor is a Third-Person shooter in a cartoonish WWII setting released in Early Access. It highly reminds me of [Battlefield Heroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_Heroes), which is probably my favorite Battlefield game.
As somewhat of a game soundtrack nerd, [its theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQc6sRvuh4M) still lives rent free in my mind.

So thank you, Heroes of Valor - I’ll be whistling that all week now.

I'm not the only one making this connection. A big chunk of players feel nostalgic towards BF:Heroes when playing this game. They love the fun gameplay and its potential.
They seem to have had some server issues, but the early reception is very positive.

## ⚔️ Early Access Graduates

* [Backpack Battles](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/279/backpack_battles) -  A PvP inventory management auto battler. Players love the Addictive, fun and relaxing gameplay - some critique gameplay balance issues, and lack of content.
* [Gladiators: Survival in Rome](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/32370/gladiators_survival_in_rome) -  A F2P survival action RPG with city building. Mixed reception overall. Players like the graphics and addictiveness - and a big chunk of players really dislikes the pay to win mechanics and the energy system.
* [Daisho: Survival of a Samurai](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/10148/daisho_survival_of_a_samurai) -  Made by same studio as the Gladiators: Survival in Rome just above. Seems like it's very similar, but a different setting. Similar criticisms and score.
