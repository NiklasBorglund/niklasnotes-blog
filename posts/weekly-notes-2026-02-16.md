While Next Fest is coming to its end, I thought we could have a look at the top releases last week.

Many demos were released in advance, topping parts of the charts - but I will cover demos in next week's post. So I left them out.

However, I can highly recommend trying out this demo called [Wielders of the Essence](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/258725/wielders_of_the_essence_demo). I might have had something to do with developing it ;)

I also compiled a list of some of the top demos that I can track here on the site with interesting metrics. You can find that list [HERE](https://niklasnotes.com/lists/dp46rj/steam-next-fest-2026-feb-23-mar-02).

But let's have a look at the releases that came out between February 16 and 22!

## Super Battle Golf by Brimstone

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "251918"
}
```

An up to 8 player golf game, where everybody plays at the same time. [Sold over 400k copies](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4069520/view/497221686832136740) so far, and players love the chaotic gameplay.

Feels like it's made for unpredictable humorous moments, clearly inspired by games like [PEAK](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/210519/peak) and [RV There Yet?](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/235439/rv_there_yet).
Friendship-ruining dynamics are celebrated, often leading to playful rivalry - especially matched with a reportedly great power-up system that can change the game play quite a bit.

It launched with an impressive overwhelmingly positive score, and there isn't that much criticism. Some players experience technical issues and players scream for more content. 

A great place to be as indie devs.

## PARANORMASIGHT: The Mermaid's Curse by Square Enix

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "256303"
}
```

This is a sequel to [PARANORMASIGHT: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/84638/paranormasight_the_seven_mysteries_of_honjo). A visual novel set in Ise-Shima, Japan, where players unravel the mysteries surrounding mermaid legends.

I've never heard of this series before, but players love both this and its predecessor - both getting overwhelmingly positive. 
Story and narrative receive praise for depth and a lot of reviews thinks this game is even better than the first one.

However, some feel the pacing is inconsistent, particularly in the early game. 
Another phrase that came up in the reviews was "True Ending" and that in this game, it was overly obtuse and complex according to many. The phrase seemed so specific that I had to look up the difference between that and just simply... an ending.

You can probably guess, but for those of you (like me) that didn't know - it's the ending that is considered canon. It is considered the official ending in products like this, and can be used to further the story more.

Anyway, a strong sequel from Square Enix.

## Horripilant by Alexandre Declos and Pas Game Studio

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "198885"
}
```

An incremental dungeon crawler with a clear retro style taking us way back into the olden days of gaming. Players awaken as a knight with no memory, exploring and battling through the depths while solving puzzles.

Interesting mix, taking the incremental playstyle and merging it with old school dungeon crawlers. The gameplay receives mixed feelings, some find the incremental part engaging while others just find it grindy.

Players praise the unique and immersive atmosphere as well as the puzzle elements.

Community engagement is valued - players appreciate the developer's responsiveness to feedback. However, resource management draws concerns about the system being tedious and unbalanced.

## Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown by Gamexcite

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "225491"
}
```

A story-driven survival strategy game published by [Daedalic Entertainment](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/publisher/Daedalic%20Entertainment) where players manage the U.S.S. Voyager.

Nostalgia factor drives enjoyment and many express enthusiasm derived from nostalgic elements related to Star Trek: Voyager. Gameplay mechanics for resource management and decision-making are appreciated, though some find it frustrating.

Character representation from Star Trek: Voyager is valued, though some feel that it lacks depth along with the narrative and story.

Save system limitations are the biggest complaint. Apparently, there is no manual save feature - leading to lost progress and increased difficulty.
Below that, RNG mechanics frustrate some players due to reliance on randomness.

If you're a Voyager fan, there's clearly something here. If you're not, the game may not give you a reason to become one.

## NORSE: Oath of Blood by Arctic Hazard

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "165057"
}
```

A turn-based strategy RPG published by [Tripwire Presents](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/publisher/Tripwire%20Presents). It had a really rough launch, with a 50% global positive rating.

Players manage a Viking settlement and engage in tactical battles, building, strategizing, and customizing characters while trying to outsmart enemies.

Voice acting quality is praised as a strong point of the game as well as the story and characters. So they seem to have nailed the general atmosphere and tone they are after.

But graphical glitches, animation quality, performance issues and just the general unfinished feel dominates the criticism. Some players write that it feels like an early access game, even though it's not.

Game feel is extremely important, and it seems like they dropped the ball on this one.

Worth noting: [Update 1.01 dropped last week](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3054690/view/540005249102907187) addressing performance, stability, combat and visuals. So maybe there's a good game underneath the bugs if they manage to fix the issues.
