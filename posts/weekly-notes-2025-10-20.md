## ⚔️ Early Access Graduates

* [Escape the Backrooms](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/59255/escape_the_backrooms) - A multiplayer horror game. Players lov the co-op experience with friends as well as the horror elements and great audio quality. Some players dislike specific levels for being poorly designed. Maybe this will change now, since they just released 1.0 - but one of the main criticisms they've received is the lack of updates and communication from the developers lately.
