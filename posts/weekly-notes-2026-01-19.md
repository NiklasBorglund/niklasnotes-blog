A week where visual polish meets mechanical roughness. MIO: Memories in Orbit brings stunning art but divisive health mechanics. LORT shows multiplayer promise despite solo balance struggles. Multiple Early Access launches reveal the challenge of shipping unfinished games, while Cult of the Lamb's Woolhaven DLC demonstrates how polished content still wins with 92% positive reviews.

Let's dive in!

## MIO: Memories in Orbit by Douze Dixièmes

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "25060"
}
```

This one looks absolutely gorgeous. A metroidvania where you play as a robot navigating a decaying spaceship.

The art style is praised, and it seems to be something they put a lot of focus on - since that was the top sentiment of their [previous game as well](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/134914/shady_part_of_me).

The soundtrack receives high praise for enhancing the overall atmosphere. Exploration mechanics are appreciated, though some criticize the lack of meaningful rewards.

However, health mechanics frustrate many players - the permanent health loss feature is particularly controversial. Probably in combination with the checkpoint system forcing the players to do long runbacks.

Lots of mixed opinions on this, causing conversation on what the players like and dislike. Platforming, combat mechanics and difficulty balance receive mixed reviews, with opinions varying on execution.

## LORT by Big Distraction

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "207110"
}
```

Getting some Orcs Must Die vibes from this, but mixed with Megabonk and multiplayer? Looks interesting, and the reviews are mostly positive.

The game emphasizes both solo and multiplayer experiences with a humorous touch, but players complain that the solo play is nearly unplayable in solo mode due to excessive enemy scaling and lack of balance.

Multiplayer experience is significantly more enjoyable - players appreciate the variety of gameplay mechanics, including abilities and weapon swapping. But enemy scaling issues extend a bit to multiplayer as well, with players frequently mentioning that scaling is excessively harsh.

Launched in Early Access, so hopefully these balancing issues will be ironed out shortly. A successful launch it seems.

## Duel Corp. by Dreameffect Entertainment

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "134132"
}
```

A Souls-inspired action RPG in Early Access set in a sandbox open world with MMO elements. Looks like they use a similar aesthetic like [Octopath Traveler](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/47394/octopath_travelertm), but with full 3d instead of the use of billboards.

Some players appreciate the unique art style and visuals, noting the aesthetic. Technical issues dominate the criticism along with players reporting that the combat mechanics are frustrating due to reliance on parrying and directional attacks.

The grindy nature of progression draws heavy criticism. NPC interactions frustrate players due to aggressive responses and bugs that disrupt. 

This is also launched in Early Access, which is apparent - and many express that the game feels unfinished and requires further development and polishing.

## Duet Night Abyss by Pan Studio

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "228140"
}
```

A free-to-play co-op action RPG where you control two protagonists navigating a fantasy world filled with demons and conspiracies.

Players appreciate the removal of gacha mechanics for characters and weapons, allowing for direct acquisition through gameplay. If I read the reviews correctly, they've used gacha mechanics for the cosmetics instead.

This game has been out on mobile, their own launcher and on the epic games store since october 2025 before it reached Steam now. So a lot of players already have played it for a while before switching to steam.

The grinding nature of gameplay is a major complaint. Technical issues are reported, including bugs, login problems, and performance concerns. Gameplay mechanics receive mixed feelings, noting both enjoyment and repetitiveness.

## Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven by Massive Monster

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "225554"
}
```

A DLC for [Cult of the Lamb](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/125545/cult_of_the_lamb) published by [Devolver Digital](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/publisher/Devolver%20Digital). 
In Woolhaven, players face new challenges including harsh winter conditions and uncovering the forgotten history of lambkind. DLCs generally get lower review counts, and it launches with an impressive 92% Very Positive from ~700 reviews.

Players appreciate the extensive new content and features added, enhancing the overall gameplay experience. 
New mechanics like ranching and winter survival elements are well-received. The art style and music in the DLC receive high praise. 
Many note the DLC adds significant replayability and extends gameplay time, making it worthwhile. Cult management mechanics are appreciated, with new depth added including rituals and follower interactions.

Community engagement is appreciated, with developers addressing issues. However, technical bugs and crashes are reported, affecting the overall experience. Some balance concerns emerge regarding difficulty and mechanics, particularly in combat.

A strong DLC reception for an already popular game.

## Early Access Graduates

* [Eldegarde](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/151850/eldegarde) - A third-person action PvPvE RPG with overall quite mixed reviews. Players like the combat and artstyle as well as the active community. However, the main criticism is about the balance between PvP and PvE elements and balancing between the classes.
```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "151850"
}
```
* [Dwarves: Glory, Death and Loot](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/5012/dwarves_glory_death_and_loot) - A strategy RPG. Players love the gameplay loop of building teams of dwarves and engaging in battles. It's praised for being replayable. The criticisms seem to be mainly about repetitiveness and grind. After a while the meta progression seems to feel like a grind and the combat mechanics feels very repetitive.
```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "5012"
}
```
* [Solargene](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/144706/solargene) - A space colony strategy and simulation game. It has significant UI, Tutorials and Control issues according to many - which seems to be the main pain points. Despite this, lot of reviewers see great potential in the game and the developers are highly responsive and engaged. It's complex and has a steep learning curve which is both appreciated and not and creates a bit of a divide.
