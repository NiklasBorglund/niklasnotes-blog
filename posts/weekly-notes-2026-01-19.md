## MIO: Memories in Orbit by Douze Dixièmes

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "25060"
}
```

This one looks absolutely gorgeous. A metroidvania where you play as a robot navigating a decaying spaceship.

The art style is praised, and it seems to be something they put a lot of focus on - since that was the top sentiment of their [previous game as well](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/134914/shady_part_of_me).

The soundtrack receives high praise for enhancing the overall atmosphere. Exploration mechanics are appreciated, though some criticize the lack of meaningful rewards.

However, health mechanics frustrate many players - the permanent health loss feature is particularly controversial. Probably in combination with the checkpoint system forcing the players to do long runbacks.

Lots of mixed opinions on this, causing conversation on what the players like and dislike. Platforming, combat mechanics and difficulty balance receive mixed reviews, with opinions varying on execution.

## LORT by Big Distraction

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "207110"
}
```

Getting some Orcs Must Die vibes from this, but mixed with Megabonk and multiplayer? Looks interesting, and the reviews are mostly positive.

The game emphasizes both solo and multiplayer experiences with a humorous touch, but players complain that the solo play is nearly unplayable in solo mode due to excessive enemy scaling and lack of balance.

Multiplayer experience is significantly more enjoyable - players appreciate the variety of gameplay mechanics, including abilities and weapon swapping. But enemy scaling issues extend a bit to multiplayer as well, with players frequently mentioning that scaling is excessively harsh.

Launched in Early Access, so hopefully these balancing issues will be ironed out shortly. A successful launch it seems.

https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/134132/duel_corp

datadump:
A Souls-inspired action RPG in Early Access set in a sandbox open world with MMO elements. Players explore a non-linear story while customizing their characters and classes, engaging solo or with friends.

Some players appreciate the unique art style and visuals, noting the aesthetic.

However, technical issues dominate the criticism - players report numerous bugs and glitches affecting gameplay, including issues with NPC interactions and combat mechanics. Combat mechanics are challenging and often frustrating due to reliance on parrying and directional attacks.

The grindy nature of progression draws heavy criticism, with players citing lack of meaningful progression leading to frustration. NPC interactions frustrate players due to aggressive responses and bugs that disrupt questing. Early Access state is apparent - many express that the game feels unfinished and requires further development and polishing.

Difficulty balance frustrates players, particularly with boss encounters and enemy scaling. The loot system is criticized for being uninteresting and lacking unique items. Multiplayer experience receives mixed feelings, with some finding it cluttered and distracting. The class system disappoints players who feel it lacks uniqueness and depth.

At ~11 hours estimated playthrough, there's content but the execution needs work.

Gameplay mechanics receive mixed feelings, noting both enjoyment and repetitiveness. Monetization strategy draws mixed reactions, particularly regarding character purchases. Character balance concerns emerge, with some characters appearing underperforming.

## Early Access Graduates

* [Eldegarde](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/151850/eldegarde) - A third-person action PvPvE RPG with overall quite mixed reviews.

"gameId": "151850"
}
```
* [Dwarves: Glory, Death and Loot](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/5012/dwarves_glory_death_and_loot) - A strategy RPG. Players love the gameplay loop of building teams of dwarves and engaging in battles. It's praised for being replayable. The criticisms seem to be mainly about repetitiveness and grind. After a while the meta progression seems to feel like a grind and the combat mechanics feels very repetitive.
```condensedgamecard

"gameId": "5012"
}
```
* [Solargene](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/144706/solargene) - A space colony strategy and simulation game. It has significant UI, Tutorials and Control issues according to many - which seems to be the main pain points.
