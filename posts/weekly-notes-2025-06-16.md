Hello everyone! Hope you had a good midsommar!

Last week we had a literal TON of releases and early access graduates. I'm actually joining the list of releases myself along with my colleagues at Lavapotion with the release of our latest faction - Roots!

## Songs of Conquest - Roots by Lavapotion
***Largest audiences**: ~64% English, ~18% Russian, ~9% Polish*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "178113"
}
```

This is what I've been working on for the last 6 months! This DLC adds a new faction, Roots, to our turn based strategy game [Songs of Conquest](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/149/songs_of_conquest).
It's the second faction DLC we've created - and this one was a blast to develop and to play. The mechanics encourage you to keep your units closer together on the battlefield - even when it’s risky.

This time around we could also re-use a lot of the code I wrote regarding locking content behind a DLC, which spared me from writing boilerplate all over again.

The DLC seems to be well liked, which makes us very happy. Around 90% positive at the time of writing.

If this looks like a game you'd enjoy, please check it out! :)

P.S. We also released the game on [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/songs-of-conquest-switch/) last week!

## 捞女游戏 by 前方工作室
***Largest audiences**: ~98% Chinese (Simplified)*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "205774"
}
```

It’s not often a game with no English support climbs all the way to the top of the charts - but this one did. 捞女游戏 is a narrative-focused interactive film with over 470 minutes of live-action footage and 38 endings.
It's directed by a Hong Kong filmmaker named Hu Yaohui. You play as Wu Yulun, a man who was emotionally exploited and now goes undercover to take down the organization that targeted him.

At the time of writing, it's sitting at a 97% Overwhelmingly Positive rating across almost 15,000 reviews. Most players love the story and acting, though some mention technical issues or feel the game promises more interactivity than it delivers.

Don't know if there's much more to say since it's basically unavailable for players not understanding Simplified Chinese - but I thought it was interesting to highlight since it topped the charts this week.

## PEAK by Landfall and Aggro Crab
***Largest audiences**: ~70% English, ~10% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "210519"
}
```

Just 2 months after the release of [Haste](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/144454/haste), Landfall dropped this collaboration with Aggro Crab.
This co-op climbing game is already an instant hit and very popular on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/peak-2025). In just 6 days they [sold one million copies](https://x.com/LandfallGames/status/1936734056089100646).

Players praise the fun gameplay, co-op experience and visual appeal. That said, it's also getting hit with complaints about frequent crashes and connection issues.

Still, Landfall keeps showing how to make something that gets people talking - and playing.

## FBC: Firebreak by Remedy Entertainment
***Largest audiences**: ~71% English, ~8% Chinese (Simplified), ~7% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "123005"
}
```

Remedy tries something new here with FBC: Firebreak – a co-op FPS set in the Control universe. It’s a break from their usual ultra story-heavy single-player experiences.

The reception so far is mixed. Players like the co-op gameplay and atmosphere, and there’s optimism about future updates. But many mention technical issues, lack of content, and missing communication tools - no in-game voice or text chat is a frequent complaint.

The game also has an interesting audience anomaly with Chinese (Simplified). Out of ~100 Simplified Chinese reviews (about 8% of the total), only 25% are positive. I haven’t had time to dig deeper yet, but my guess is the lack of communication tools hits harder there.

If Remedy can follow through on content and polish, there’s a solid foundation here.

## Broken Arrow by Steel Balalaika
***Largest audiences**: ~41% English, ~22% Russian, ~21% Chinese (Simplified)*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "65763"
}
```

Broken Arrow is a modern military tactics game where you command hundreds of units and build custom army decks.

The reception is mostly positive with some clear caveats. People enjoy the unit variety, engaging mechanics, and developer presence.
But the game takes hits for lacking solid single-player features, having server stability issues, and allowing cheaters to slip into multiplayer.

Chinese (Simplified) stands out with a 56% rating and is 20+ percent of the player base. Hard to say if it’s cultural expectations or technical problems driving that, but the dip is significant, and something the devs may want to address early.
