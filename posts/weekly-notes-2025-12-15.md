With the winter sale in full steam and the Christmas holidays not much was released on Steam last week, but we still saw some noteworthy games worth looking at.

Let's check it out!

## PIONER by GFAGames

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "231597"
}
```

An open-world MMO first-person shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world launching in Early Access.
Many players like the gameplay mechanics despite the reported bugs. Numerous reviews highlight bugs including infinite loading screens and progression issues.

Server stability issues with disconnections and inability to log in are frequently reported.

A rough launch, but the majority of issues seems to be around bugs - so hopefully they'll be able to patch it over time.

## A Game About Feeding A Black Hole by Aarimous & Thornityco

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "231597"
}
```

An incremental clicker where players feed a black hole. Reminds me a bit about a game released a couple of months ago named [Keep on Mining!](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/212523/keep_on_mining) when looking at the screens. 
A dopamine heavy game by the looks of it. The incremental mechanics provide a satisfying progression experience as well as the visual appeal and sound design are appreciated among players.

However, several reviews mention the game's short length and some find the mid-game progression grindy. 
Skill tree design receives mixed feelings. Players express disappointment over the lack of automation common in idle games.

## Raiders of Blackveil by Wombo Games

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "201437"
}
```

A multiplayer roguelite action RPG in Early Access launching with mixed reviews. A lot of reviews complain about the game having an always online requirement and just general multiplayer connectivity issues.
They also report progress loss due to bugs and server issues. 

However, despite the issues players appreciate the unique gameplay mechanics, art style, and progression system.

## Early Access Graduates

* [Mon Bazou](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/53872/mon_bazou) - A quirky Canadian car building and street racing game. Immediately reminds me of [My Summer Car](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/36603/my_summer_car). Players love the mechanics of producing and selling maple syrup as well as customizing their car. It has a lovely humorous atmosphere that is greatly appreciated. Among criticisms is that the game can feel a bit grindy at times and that some players experience bugs and technical issues.
```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "53872"
}
```
* [Swordhaven: Iron Conspiracy](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/130576/swordhaven_iron_conspiracy) - A fantasy CRPG. Players love the exploration rewards, the variety in quests and the complexity in the dialogue and characters. They also love the effort in translating the game to simplified chinese. Some express mixed feelings about the combat system and map design. A number of reviews also mention technical issues.
