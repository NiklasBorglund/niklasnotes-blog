Strategy and management took the spotlight this week along with user interface as the main complaint among Europa Universalis and Football Manager 26.
Tavern Keeper, meanwhile, opened its doors to warm Early Access applause

Let's dive in!

## Europa Universalis V by Paradox Tinto

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "203750"
}
```

Latest entry in the series, succeeding the very popular [Europa Universalis IV](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/156811/europa_universalis_iv) which was released 12 years ago. 
And by the looks of it, players seem to appreciate what they brought with them for this game and the improvements they did. 
The features revolving automation seem to be one of the highlights that they like.

However, the UI complexity frustrates many, with players finding it cluttered and difficult to navigate. And many experience crashes, lag, and performance problems particularly on high-end systems

It's the second large strategy title this year that I see such widespread complaints about the UI specifically - the other one is [Civilization VII](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/22514/sid_meier_s_civilization_vii).

## Football Manager 26 by Sports Interactive

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "229227"
}
```

Speaking of UI complaints, the latest version of Football Manager launched with only 22% global positive score. Quite the drop from [Football Manager 2024](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/126487/football_manager_2024) which sits currently on 91%.

This game has a completely new UI, and it is by far the biggest complaint. In a management game like this, it needs to be easy to use and understand - which seems like it's not this time around.
The removal of features that existed in previous iterations particularly angers long-time fans.

It's not all bad, some appreciate the match engine improvements with better graphics and tactical options, but these positives are completely overshadowed by the negatives.

## Tavern Keeper by Greenheart Games

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "45579"
}
```

This might be the winner this week in terms of critical acclaim among the reviews. It launched in Early Access with overwhelmingly positive reviews. 
They've had a demo out for quite a long time before launch and the development has taken over [10 years](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/my-kids-werent-born-yet-and-now-theyre-in-primary-school-learning-how-to-make-their-own-games-game-dev-tycoon-studio-head-talks-taking-10-years-to-make-his-upcoming-inn-sim-tavern-keeper/).

Their previous game was also a smash hit when it released 12 years ago - [Game Dev Tycoon](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/151153/game_dev_tycoon).

Players love the engaging narrator interactions - the humor enhances the entire experience. The colorful art style creates a cozy atmosphere that players appreciate.

The gameplay mechanics including managing staff and tavern operations feel satisfying. The developers' responsiveness and community engagement stand out.

However, some concerns exist about staff management challenges & performance issues.

Content limitations are noted for an Early Access title, with some expressing concerns about replayability and depth.

## Desktop Defender by Conradical Games

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "219115"
}
```

After launching [a successful demo](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/236617/desktop_defender_demo) at the most recent next fest - this idle auto-battler that runs on your desktop launches with Overwhelmingly Positive.
Players love the concept of multitasking - defending your desktop while working or browsing. The developer engagement enhances the community experience.

The visual effects and user interface get praise for responsiveness and ease of use. However, technical issues including performance problems and bugs affect some players. Weapon effectiveness and variety concerns arise, with some feeling the game lacks depth in strategic elements.

## The Last Caretaker by Channel37 Ltd

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "185949"
}
```

Players praise the immersive atmosphere and engaging storytelling elements in The Last Caretaker. 
The crafting and resource management aspects feel engaging and satisfying. The unique gameplay mechanics including crafting and exploration work well.

However, performance issues significantly affect the experience - many report frame drops and crashes, especially in demanding areas.

## Sonic Rumble by SEGA

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "132737"
}
```

A free-to-play arcade royale racing/runner game in the Sonic universe where you battle it out with up to 32 other players online.

With only 50% positive - players generally enjoy the gameplay, noting its very fun to play although with some critique of repetitiveness. 

The top complaints revolve around monetization as it often is around F2P-titles. Players really dislike the aggressive strategies they use along with popup ads encouraging purchases and the high price for skins.
