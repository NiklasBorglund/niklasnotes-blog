Guild Wars Reforged brings back the classic MMORPG with strong nostalgia. ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN's new DLC disappoints with map design complaints. ROUTINE and Dungeon Rampage impress with as high scores as 91% and 94% respectively.

Let's have a look!

## ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN The Forsaken Hollows by FromSoftware, Inc.

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "245274"
}
```

A new expansion for [ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/98557/elden_ring_nightreign) that launches with mixed reviews. Map design issues are the top complaint where players criticize the new map for confusing layout and lack of intuitive navigation.
Players express frustration over the absence of new weapons, spells, and Ashes of War in the DLC.

Community expectations is also something players mention alot with promised content and features weren't delivered. 

However, the introduction of new characters, particularly the Undertaker and Scholar, receives positive feedback for their unique abilities. 

In general the reception is divided, with players expressing both enjoyment and disappointment.

## Guild Wars® Reforged by ArenaNet®

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "246107"
}
```

Writing about this game fills me with nostalgia - I spent a decent amount of hours in both Guild Wars 1 & 2 back in the day. 
Here, with the reforged version, players seem to express similar feelings of nostalgia and is quite well received with very positive reviews.

Players enjoy the unique gameplay mechanics including the class system and build flexibility. New game accessibility features like controller support are appreciated.

However, players experience difficulties logging into their accounts, often encountering error messages and being unable to access their game. Because of that customer support experience also receives negative feedback.

## ROUTINE by Lunar Software

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "176880"
}
```

A first-person sci-fi horror game set on an abandoned lunar base. Published by Raw Fury, who has had alot of good releases lately ([Monsters are Coming! Rock & Road](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/208617/monsters_are_coming_rock_road), [The Séance of Blake Manor](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/133621/the_s%C3%A9ance_of_blake_manor), [Blue Prince](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/117111/blue_prince)).

ROUTINE also launches very positive with 91%. The strong atmosphere creates a sense of immersion and tension, and visual and audio design receive frequent praise for high quality and immersive qualities.

Another mixed opinion discussion within the reviews is that some find the puzzles engaging while others criticize them for being tedious or unfun.

## Dungeon Rampage by Gamebreaking Studios

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "183763"
}
```

As I understand it, this game is a revival of a classic of an online dungeon crawler [released back in 2011](https://dungeonrampage.fandom.com/wiki/Dungeon_Rampage_Wiki). 

Players love it and express a strong sense of nostalgia for the original game, highlighting its familiar mechanics and charm. The players express hope for future updates to improve gameplay and add content during the early access.

The biggest criticism is the good ol' technical issues though, with crashes, low FPS, lag, and bugs affecting gameplay.

## OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 by Square Enix & DOKIDOKI GROOVE WORKS

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "220069"
}
```
The latest of Square Enix's [trademarked HD-2D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD-2D#:~:text=grew%20up%20with.-,Branding%20and%20trademarks,the%20company%20in%20future%20titles.) type of games (which I guess, we are not allowed to call [Songs of Conquest](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/149/songs_of_conquest) ;) ).

Apart from its critically acclaimed predecessors, this game launched with just mixed reviews. Players appreciate the new town building mechanics which add depth to the gameplay experience. The classic turn-based combats and the ability to customize your character is highly appreciated.

On the criticism side - many report that audio quality, particularly for voice lines, is heavily compressed and detracts from the overall experience and the story quality receives criticism for being unengaging, repetitive, and lacking depth

---

## Destiny 2: Renegades by Bungie

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "229845"
}
```

Destiny is also one of those games that I played a lot on my PS4 - both 1 & 2. I'm one of those crazy people who played it single player - and I loved it.

This expansion gets a very poor reception at launch with only 58% at the time of writing. Players discuss the introduction of new gameplay mechanics, such as something named Praxic Blade and heat blaster weapons. Narrative quality receives mixed feedback - some praise it while others find it lacking.
The Star Wars elements also draws criticism about the quality of the execution of it.

The community's overall sentiment towards the game is polarized, with many expressing dissatisfaction. DLCs are in general quite difficult, especially with such a big fanbase as Destiny 2 and their sky-high expectations of new content.

## Early Access Graduates

* [Pro Soccer Online](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/45569/pro_soccer_online) - A skill-based online multiplayer soccer game. Players like the fun mechanics and the potential of what the game could be. 
The latest update has gotten massive critique of essentially downgrading the entire experience. Some reviews attribute this to an upgrade to Unreal Engine 5, but as a game developer myself I question if that is really true. Seems more like a nifty catch phrase to blame the engine. Lots of players also dislike the toxic community - especially towards new players.
```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "45569"
}
```
* [Tiny Bunny](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/1701/tiny_bunny) - A visual novel set in a Siberian forest where children go missing. Players love the atmosphere, art style and voice acting quality. Just general mood seems to be something they've nailed in this one. The 5th and final episode stands out as not meeting the expectations of what was set by earlier episodes and is the largest criticism by far.
```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "1701"
}
```
* [Rhythm Doctor](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/94114/rhythm_doctor) - A rhythm game where players defibrillate patients' hearts in sync with their heartbeats. Players love that you control the game with only one button. Players also love the story, sound track and the emotional impact of the story. Which to me sound unusual for a rhythm game. Generally very well praised, but some players reportedly experience some technical issues.
```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "94114"
}
```
* [Survive the Nights](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/53936/survive_the_nights) - An open-world survival sandbox game. Players see the potential of what the game could be, and that is generally fun to play. A lot of reviews mention the many bugs and glitches ruining their experience as well as the slow pace and non-communication from the developers.
```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "53936"
}
```
* [Flotsam](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/108246/flotsam) - A strategy and simulation game. Players love the aesthetics and art style along with the unique game concept. They dislike the many bugs and issue with soft locks and unresponsive elements often being reported. One thing to note is the significantly lower ratings among the Simplified Chinese reviews giving it only 61%.
```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "108246"
}
```
* [Old School Rally](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/67041/old_school_rally) - A retro-style racing game. Players love the PS1-esque graphics making it feel like a game from that era. They also appreciate the amount of content available. Some players think the UI needs improvement and that the co-driver's callouts are ill-timed.
```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "67041"
}
```
* [CivIdle](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/63074/cividle) - A free-to-play strategy simulation game. Players love the active support from the community and developers. They often discuss (and like) the complexity of the resource management and the effort it takes to learn the game. The main criticism is confusion around the UI, many describe it as cluttered tied with concerns about game balance.
