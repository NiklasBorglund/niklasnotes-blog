* [CivIdle](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/63074/cividle) - A free-to-play strategy simulation game. Players love the active support from the community and developers. They often discuss (and like) the complexity of the resource management and the effort it takes to learn the game. The main criticism is confusion around the UI, many describe it as cluttered tied with concerns about game balance.
