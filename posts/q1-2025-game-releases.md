This is the first post on the blog — short and to the point, while I’m still building out the system. But I didn’t want to let Q1 slip by without sharing a few thoughts on what’s been released so far in 2025.

Turns out: **it’s been a great start to the year, especially for smaller and weirder games.**

## 🧪 *Schedule I* — The surprise indie standout

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "72681"
}
```

*Schedule I* quietly came out of nowhere and ended up one of the most talked-about games of the quarter in certain circles. It's bold, unnerving, and not for everyone — which is exactly why it worked. If you're into slightly surreal, high-conflict experiences, it's worth a look.

## 🧨 *Split Fiction* — A smash hit

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "61387"
}
```

Can't wait to play this one myself. Hazelight and Josef Fares have (yet again) released a massive hit. Making a co-op only game is a big risk, but they keep proving that if the game is good enough, it’ll sell anyway.

---

## 🏰 *Kingdom Come: Deliverance II* — Highly anticipated and praised

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "58360"
}
```

A game that reminded everyone that highly immersive single-player RPGs are still very much alive. It’s praised for its rich story and world, and currently sits at a strong 93% positive rating.

## 🗡️ *Assassin’s Creed Shadows* — A mixed return

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "73697"
}
```

I haven’t played Assassin’s Creed since the Ezio days, and it seems like the series has evolved quite a bit. The reception is mostly positive (81% at the time of writing), but many players are frustrated by technical issues and the inclusion of microtransactions in a full-price single-player game.

## 🧪 A rocky start for some AAA releases

```condensedgamecard-grid
[
{ "gameId": "22514" },
{ "gameId": "151952" },
{ "gameId": "186160" }
]
```

We saw a few high-profile launches stumble out of the gate:

* **Sid Meier’s Civilization VII** — Players cite an unfinished feel and poor UI. I was personally excited about this one, but I’m holding off until it gets patched.

* **Monster Hunter Wilds** — Selling well, but still only around 58-60% positive. Major issues with performance, even on high-end rigs.

* **GTA V: Enhanced Edition** — The new version replaced the old one on the store, and users are struggling with migration issues. It’s sitting at just 63% positive at the time of writing.

Combined with rising prices and increasing development costs, it begs the question: Are big-budget releases becoming too risky?

## 🛠️ Other quick notes

- **Exited Early Access**: *My Summer Car* & *Dying Light* released their 1.0 versions.
- **Unusual blends**: Games like *ENA: Dream BBQ* and *R.E.P.O.* combine style and genre in unexpected ways — which made them stand out.
