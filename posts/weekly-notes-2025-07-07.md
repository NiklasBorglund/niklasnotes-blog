The Summer Sale is over, and I expected things to slow down a bit. But a surprising number of games launched right after the sale ended.

My gut feeling is it’s better to wait a bit - most players probably picked up more than one game during the sale and still have things to play.

But let’s dive in and see what showed up.

## RimWorld - Odyssey by Ludeon Studios

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "210129"
}
```

Ludeon Studios just released their latest DLC for RimWorld. This time, you're building a ship and traveling across the planet.

Players generally love the added depth and new gameplay possibilities. Some feel that existing mods already offer similar (or better) systems - but that’s often the case when a game has a strong modding community.

As a sidenote, I love this developer breakdown of [their region system in Rimworld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMBQn_sg7DA). I'm a systems guy myself, and when I saw this I got very inspired and added a similar system to Songs of Conquest.

## Mycopunk by Pigeons at Play

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "202147"
}
```

I'm getting Borderlands vibes when looking at the screenshots for this game.

Players really enjoy the gunplay, humor, and soundtrack. Negatives mostly mention visual noise, tech issues, and a lack of enemy variety.

Still, very positive score across the board -and seems like a sleeper hit if you're into co-op shooters

## PATAPON 1+2 REPLAY by SAS CO.,LTD.

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "195968"
}
```

There’s something I love about rhythm games - and I think the genre’s still a bit underdeveloped, even with all the variety we’ve seen over the years.

I remember when Patapon was released, I even bought a used PSP to be able to play it - so it's nice to see it resurface again.

Players are generally positive and the main praise is feelings of nostalgia. That said, lots of players report input lag - which is a big no no in timing based rhythm games.

## Brickadia by Brickadia, LLC

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "105607"
}
```

Brickadia is described as a "next-generation brick building sandbox game" where they try and take creative freedom to the next level. Judging by the reviews, they’ve built up a solid community over time.

Players highlight the strong community support and a really well-designed building system. If you’re working on anything similar, it might be worth taking a closer look.

General mood is positive, with some complaints about content and bugs, but I'd believe those issues will be ironed out over time since it's the start of early access.

## Tony Hawk's™ Pro Skater™ 3 + 4 by Iron Galaxy Studios

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "186724"
}
```

Two years after the remake of [Tony Hawk's™ Pro Skater™ 1 + 2](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/107686/tony_hawk_stm_pro_skatertm_1_2), they have now released the 3rd and 4th entry in the series as well.

It's getting mixed reviews at the moment, and it's mostly regarding changes they made from the original games. The soundtrack, level design and career modes all got some changes - and they seem to not be received well in general for players who want to relive the nostalgia.

## Last Report by Monopixel Games

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "36348"
}
```

Let's turn our eyes to this potential hidden gem that was released. It's a very short psychological horror, point & click game with pixel art and a whole lot of mood and atmosphere.
By the calculations on this site, it seems like you can finish this one just under the refund window of 2 hours.

Players love the atmosphere and story, but complain about the shortness. Some complain about the writing quality and the lack of save options. Mixed opinions about the gameplay mechanics. 

Still, it has a 90+ score at the time of writing, which is very good for something this short.

A subtitle like ‘Last Report: A Short Experience’ might’ve helped set expectations better. These ultra-short games usually do best when they communicate clearly what you're getting.
