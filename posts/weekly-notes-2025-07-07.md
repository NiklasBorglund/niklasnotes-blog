The Summer Sale is over, and I thought releases would cool down a bit, but we had quite a few this week. Released very shortly after the sale was over.
My personal gut feeling would be that it's more beneficial to wait a bit - since so many players probably bought more than one game at the sale.

But lets dive in and see what we've got!

## RimWorld - Odyssey by Ludeon Studios
***Largest audiences**: ~53% English, ~13% Russian, ~11% Chinese (Simplified)*

"gameId": "210129"
}
```

Tynan Sylvester and his Ludeon Studios released the latest DLC of Rimworld. In this DLC you get to build your own ship and travel across the planet


As a sidenote, I love this developer breakdown of their region system in Rimworld: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMBQn_sg7DA. I'm a systems guy myself, and when I saw this I got very inspired and added a similar system to Songs of Conquest.
