The Summer Sale is over, and I thought releases would cool down a bit, but we had quite a few this week. Released very shortly after the sale was over.
My personal gut feeling would be that it's more beneficial to wait a bit - since so many players probably bought more than one game at the sale.

But lets dive in and see what we've got!

## RimWorld - Odyssey by Ludeon Studios
***Largest audiences**: ~53% English, ~13% Russian, ~11% Chinese (Simplified)*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "210129"
}
```

Tynan Sylvester and his Ludeon Studios released the latest DLC of Rimworld. In this DLC you get to build your own ship and travel across the planet

The players love the expansion in general and how it adds to the gameplay, brings in another level of depth to the whole experience. Some disagree with that, and think that some existing mods expand the loop better.

As a sidenote, I love this developer breakdown of their region system in Rimworld: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMBQn_sg7DA. I'm a systems guy myself, and when I saw this I got very inspired and added a similar system to Songs of Conquest.

## PATAPON 1+2 REPLAY by SAS CO.,LTD.
***Largest audiences**: ~49% English, ~20% Chinese (Simplified), ~6% Korean, ~6% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "195968"
}
```

There's something about rhythm games that I love - and although there are many different games I think there is somewhat of an underdeveloped genre.
Eventhough I can't say I've played all of them.

I remember when Patapon was released, I even bought a used PSP to be able to play it - so it's nice to see it resurface again.

Players are generally positive and the main praise is feelings of Nostalgia. On the contrary, lots of players report input lag - which is a big no no in timing based rhythm games.

## Brickadia by Brickadia, LLC
***Largest audiences**: ~90% English, ~4% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "105607"
}
```

Brickadia is described as a "next-generation brick building sandbox game" where they try and take creative freedom to the next level. By reading the reviews - it seems like it has a steady community that they've built up over time.

And that is also what many of the players mention - the strong community support is a highlight of many. They also mention the excellent building system, so if you are a developer implementing something similar - this one might be worth checking out.

I sense an overall feeling of positivity and enthusiasm, some complaints about lack of content and bugs, but I'd believe those issues will be ironed out over time since it's the start of early access.

## Tony Hawk's™ Pro Skater™ 3 + 4 by Iron Galaxy Studios
***Largest audiences**: ~86% English*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "186724"
}
```

Two years after the remake of [Tony Hawk's™ Pro Skater™ 1 + 2](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/107686/tony_hawk_stm_pro_skatertm_1_2), they have now released the 3rd and 4th entry in the series as well.

It's getting mixed reviews at the moment, and it's mostly regarding changes they made from the original games. The soundtrack, level design and career modes all got some changes - and they seem to not be received well in general for players who wants to relive the nostalgia.

## Last Report by Monopixel Games
***Largest audiences**: ~68% English, ~19% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "36348"
}
```

Let's turn our eyes to this potential hidden gem that was released. It's a very short psychological horror, point & click game with pixel art and a whole lot of mood and atmosphere.
By the calculations on this site, it seems like you can finish this one just under the refund window of 2 hours.

Players love the atmosphere and story, but complain about the shortness. Some complain about the writing quality and the lack of save options. Mixed opinions about the gameplay mechanics. 

Maybe if they had named the game with a subtitle would have improved the score even more - "Last Report - a short experience" or something of the like. These ultra-short games usually win big on setting the expectations perfectly - and I wonder if 

Still, it has a 90+ score at the time of writing, which is very good.
