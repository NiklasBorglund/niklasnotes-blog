## Nioh 3 by KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "208851"
}
```

Nioh 3 is certainly the top release this week. It got a strong start with very positive reviews. 
The combat is getting a lot of praise, and the customization side seems to land well too. Players can feel that the core formula is still doing its job.

Most of the criticism is around polish. 
Performance is the biggest recurring complaint, with visual quality and difficulty tuning also showing up a lot. 
There are also some frustrations around AI/enemy behavior and parts of the loot experience, but those are secondary compared to the technical issues reported.

## MENACE by Overhype Studios

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "37689"
}
```

MENACE is a turn-based tactical RPG from the same developers that created [Battle Brothers](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/66233/battle_brothers) and published by [Hooded Horse](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/publisher/Hooded%20Horse).

The praise is mostly about gameplay and overall presentation - players also appreciate the replayability due to the procedural generation aspects. 

The criticism is more about systems friction: balancing comes up a lot, AI behavior gets called out repeatedly, and the supply system seems to create more frustration than intended.

It seems like the game has a solid foundation, and sits exactly where you want to be in terms of criticism for an Early Access game. The core holds up, and balancing and technical issues can be ironed out over time.

## YAP YAP by BAP HQ & Maison Bap

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "217986"
}
```

A magic-themed co-op horror game, where you and up to 5 friends cause mayhem in towers using spells and magic.

It is getting a pretty warm reception overall, mostly because the style is distinct and the core idea feels fresh. 
Players seem to like the vibe, the visual direction, and the sheer fun of playing with your friends in multiplayer.

Where it starts to wobble is in long-session friction. Repetition shows up often in reviews, and technical issues (including crashes) are a recurring pain point. 
There’s also some frustration around limited customization and replayability.

## PUBG: BLINDSPOT by PUBG Corporation & ARC Team

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "185409"
}
```

PUBG Corporation's first game after the ever popular [PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/72698/pubg_battlegrounds).

It is a top-down shooter game that got luke warm reception with Mixed reviews at the time of writing. 
I imagine there are some sky-high expectations to be met from the already existing player base even though this is a completely different game.

The top-down format and teamwork-heavy design are the main positives, especially for players looking for something more tactical than a standard run-and-gun shooter.
The reception is being held back mainly by balance concerns, server/connectivity complaints and matchmaking friction.

Also an Early Access launch, and compared to battlegrounds they have quite a few reviews. I'm assuming if they fix the technical issues, they could push quite a big audience their way if they want to.

## DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined by Square Enix & HEXADRIVE Inc.

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "230450"
}
```

A remake of DRAGON QUEST VII. Players who came in for nostalgia and quality-of-life improvements seem pretty happy with it.

The pushback mainly comes from players who feel the reimagined version removed or "streamlined" the gameplay too much. Simplified difficulty, removed content, and reduced depth are common complaints - with technical issues adding extra friction on top.

Still, it sits on a comfortable 91% global positive - so I imagine the vast majority is pretty happy with this one.
