Skate Story's surreal glass demon skateboarding impresses with its Blood Cultures soundtrack and artistic vision. Ashes of Creation's long-awaited MMORPG faces a rough launch with server issues after years of development.

Let's have a look in between browsing the best discounts of the winter sale ;)

## Ashes of Creation by Intrepid Studios, Inc

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "243154"
}
```

Described on the store as "an old-school take on the modern MMORPG". Launching in Early Access at just Mixed reviews, some players appreciate the visual quality and potential of the gameplay, noting its graphical quality.
A lot of reviews state that they've been following the game for quite some time, and many even prepurchased it many years ago since its [first announcement back in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashes_of_Creation) - and they complain that it still feels unfinished as it launches on steam.

Server stability issues are the top complaint with players facing frequent server crashes and long queue times. Some players also face account linking issues with their steam account, making them unable to play.
Gameplay wise seems to have mixed opinions all around, all from the game play, in game cash shop and combat etc. Some people enjoy it, others don't.

A rough launch for this game (and it seems to have been quite a rough development as well when reading about it). Will be interesting to see if they can turn this around.

## UNBEATABLE by D-CELL GAMES

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "93893"
}
```

An anime-inspired rhythm adventure game where players navigate a colorful world while engaging in simple rhythm gameplay. Players find the Arcade mode available in the game to be engaging, enjoyable and fun.
The soundtrack is frequently mentioned as good (which is super important in a rhythm game).

Story mode pacing issues draw significant criticism, even though equally many praise the emotional impact of the story, they describe the pacing as rushed and poorly structured. Technical bugs and glitches are also widely reported.

## Skate Story by Sam Eng

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "134701"
}
```

This game looks insanely cool to me. Not your normal skating game. It's set in the Underworld where you play as a glass demon on a quest to skate to the Moon and published by Devolver Digital.

Players frequently comment on the unique and surreal visual style, describing it along with the story as beautiful and artistic. The soundtrack from the band Blood Cultures is very much appreciated. Skating mechanics and controls are often discussed, with players noting that it just feels good to play.

Some players report technical issues including bugs and performance problems that detract from the overall experience, but in general the impression from players is very positive.

## Terminator 2D: NO FATE by Bitmap Bureau

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "187922"
}
```

A pixel art retro styled game based on Terminator 2. Players express strong nostalgia for the franchise and the many games it draws inspiration from (which I guess are games like Metal Slug & Contra just by looking at the screenshots).
Gameplay mechanics feature a mix of gameplay styles and is generally well appreciated.

However, many players thinks the game is too short. The estimated playtime here on Niklas Notes estimates it to be completed around 4 hours. Which makes them also feel like the price is too high.
Some players report control difficulties as well, particularly on PC.

## Bits & Bops by Bitmap Bureau

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "82955"
}
```

Another rhythm game released this week. This is a collection of rhythm mini-games featuring catchy music and hand-drawn animation. 

Players praise the charming visuals and audio quality, noting the artistic effort put into the game. It's often compared to [Rhythm Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_Heaven) in a positive light.

Players express hope for future community features, such as modding or additional content. However, many reviews mention the short playtime, often completing it in under three hours. The estimated playthrough time on Niklas Notes is also around 3 hours, so that checks out.

## Early Access Graduates

* [Pioneers of Pagonia](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/117180/pioneers_of_pagonia) - I actually have this in my library, but haven't picked it up yet. So this serves as a reminder as I love the old settlers games (especially 3 & 4). That is also what players seem to love, the nostalgia and familiar gameplay to the early settlers games along with the beautiful artstyle. Main complaints are the combat mechanics - players often get overwhelmed by enemy counts and poor AI behavior at the same time. Some also express frustration about the complex building system, lack of depth of gameplay and complicated resource management. 
```condensedgamecard

"gameId": "117180"
}
```
* [Dunjungle](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/44051/dunjungle) - An action-packed roguelite where you play as a monkey. Players love the fluidity in the combat and the addictive gameplay. The main selling points of the game seems to be the things players like in general - replayability, bosses, amount of weapons etc. Some players dislike the balance of the gameplay as well as control issues when they are used to a different setup with similar games.   
```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "44051"
}
```
* [Netherworld Covenant](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/96036/netherworld_covenant) - A dark fantasy 3D isometric action roguelike. Players love the Hades and Dark-souls inspired combat, the amount of customization options for the characters and the replayability. Lately, players have been experiencing technical issues and glitches, which is the main complaint. Some players also have criticisms about the design of the enemies, awkward localization and sound design.
