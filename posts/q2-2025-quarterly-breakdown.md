Hey!

Since we are now a few weeks into Q3, I thought we could do a deeper dive into what actually happened during the previous quarter on Steam.

I was thinking of how to do this and what is actually interesting and valuable information. 

I thought - is a global list really that interesting to look at? And sure, it has its merit - what is globally popular. 
But after analyzing so many games since the launch of Niklas Notes - the audiences can be wildly different depending on a multitude of factors.
It could be localization, it could be cultural differences - or it could simply be that this type of game wasn't heavily marketed in that region.

So I started to look if I could create something more interesting. Something that captures where the attention of different groups of players lies.

After some hammering on my keyboard, I got something that compiled into a new type of list. A list that I call "Attention Lists".
It takes all the games released within the quarter, sorts them by amount of reviews of a specific language - and then I sort again on highest score. 

That gives us a look, whether positive or negative - which game among this audience gathered most attention.
If a game got absolutely poor reviews - but the amount was considerable - it will show up on the list. Sometimes it's just as important to see what didn't go well as opposed to what did go well.

I have lists for all languages, but in order to not create a 200 page wall of text, I decided to focus on the languages that are the top 5 within all regions.

Steam User Top 5 System Languages from the [Hardware & Software Survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam)
* **English:** ~36%
* **Simplified Chinese:** ~28%
* **Russian:** ~9%
* **Spanish (Spain):** ~4%
* **Portuguese (Brazil):** ~4%

## The Global Winners

Let's start with looking at the games that we can find in every list. They had a global appeal and caused some sort of a wave in the industry.

### Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 by Sandfall Interactive

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "62059"
}
```

At the number 1 spot of every list is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. It quickly rose to be the top GOTY contender for a lot of player. 
Made by a core team of around 30 developers in France and they reported end of May that they sold [3.3 million copies](https://bsky.app/profile/expedition33.bsky.social/post/3lq5u7no5522n). I'm sure they sold alot more since.

Players absolutely love it's outstanding story, beautiful graphics, and incredible soundtrack. Some players feel like the combat system is overrated, but those are in great minority.

At the time of writing, this Final Fantasy inspired RPG sits on a solid 95% Overwhelmingly Positive score. Sandfall Interactive showed that they are a studio to be reckoned with.

### ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN by FromSoftware, Inc.

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "98557"
}
```

FromSoftware released this standalone adventure in the Elden Ring universe focusing on a 3 player co-op experience. 
It was, as expected, the talk of the town when it was released. 

Players love the experience when it's played with 2 other friends as intended, it has it's trademark difficulty and challenging gameplay.
Playing solo, however - is not as enjoyable to many - and co-op with only one friend is not something the game support - which it got massive critique for.

One interesting thing to note here is that when the game was released, the game got absolutely hammered by the chinese audience, giving it only a [27% positive rating](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/blog/weekly-notes-2025-05-26).

Looking only at the latest month, it seemed to have gone up to a respectable 70%. Goes to show that steadily updating and listening to player feedback can turn things around over time.

## The Almost Global Winners (Leaving money on the table?)

Here are games that got attention in all the top 5 markets but one! Sometimes it's a matter of localization, sometimes it's something else.

Let's dive into the games and see if we can find why!


### DELTARUNE by tobyfox

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "139989"
}
```

Missing/Underperforming? Market: Chinese Simplified
Localized Languages: English, Japanese

In a strong second place in ALL of the other markets. I do believe that this is mainly a localization thing. 
Widely acclaimed everywhere, and I get the sense that chinese market likes story heavy and unique gaming experiences.

### PEAK by Landfall, Aggro Crab, Landcrab & Team PEAK

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "139989"
}
```

Missing/Underperforming? Market: Chinese Simplified
Localized Languages: Only English at the time!
Sold a gigantic amount of copies in a very short time.
Significantly high score, although the chinese market seems to judge bugs and connection issues more than others. So it will be interesting to see how this pans out.

They JUST now in Q2 added support for a host of new languages. So I think this will change: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498325386812199726?snr=1_5_9_

### REMATCH by Sloclap

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "148924"
}
```

Missing/Underperforming? Market: Chinese Simplified
Localized Languages: 14 Languages, including all of the top markets
Football game, getting decent reviews but not raving. It actually has an audience anomaly here for Chinese (Simplified) - the ~500 reviews they had there would give the game only 57% positive.

TODO:: FIND OUT WHY!
Thought: Could it be because football/soccer is not a popular sport in china?
