Last week was dominated with Steam Next Fest Demos, and usually we don't see that many releases of games then, but a few full releases still managed to stand out.

Escape From Duckov launched to Overwhelmingly Positive reviews with its humorous take on extraction shooters. 
BALL x PIT continues the trend of critically acclaimed survivor-likes, while Fellowship brought a new fantasy online RPG to Early Access.

Let's look at what launched alongside all those demos!

## Escape From Duckov by Team Soda

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "38555"
}
```

Apart from the many demos this week - Escape from Duckov seems to be the winner. The name is (I assume) a humorous play on the very popular [Escape from Tarkov](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/adult/game/230942/escape_from_tarkov) - that is being released on Steam next month.

With Overwhelmingly Positive score shortly after launch - players love the fun gameplay and the active community and response from the developers. They appreciate the art style, using ducks and the unique twist on the extraction shooter genre. 

It's a single player game, so the main critique is more of a feature request - a subset of players really want multiplayer and/or co-op support, since they think it would enhance the experience.

The large majority of reviews are written in Chinese, around 75% - will be interesting to see if this game will attract other audiences as time goes by.

## BALL x PIT by Kenny Sun

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "209332"
}
```

After the recent success of [Megabonk](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/64937/megabonk), Ball x PIT seems to be the latest critically acclaimed game in these type of games. 

You face hordes of enemies and gather the loot to expand your home base. With currently 95% positive, players love its addictiveness and the unique genre combination - giving a sense of freshness to the experience.
The base building is much appreciated along with its meta-progression system.

Some players think it gets a bit repetitive and shallow after a while. 7% of all the reviews are Steam Deck players, which is high. Usually I see 2-3% on verified titles.

## Fellowship by Chief Rebel

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "94963"
}
```

A fantasy online RPG where you play with up to 4 friends that was just released in Early Access. Players love the focus on Dungeon runs and the right gameplay loop. 
They see the potential and are excited over future updates. This feels different to other MMOs according to some, which is exciting to many.

The overwhelming criticism is server issues, long queue times and just general instability. If we look at the audience split, then there's a clear positive score discrepancy between the english audience and most other languages. 
I'm guessing they have some regions they prioritize, but I also assume that this will be ironed out over time.

## Mohrta by Scumhead & Osiol

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "58711"
}
```

A "non-linear FPS adventure" with a clear retro art style similar to DOOM and other classic titles. It's even made in the [GZDoom Engine](https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom), which is a fork of the original Doom Engine.

Players love the art style and the satisfying combat and world building. Overall very positive, but some players report some technical issues and performance drops.

## ⚔️ Early Access Graduates

* [Necesse](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/147590/necesse) - A procedurally generated sandbox open world survival crafting game. Players love the creative building, npc management and just the overall management. Some players feel it can become repetitive over time and lacking in depth.

## Steam Next Fest Demos

Niklas Notes picks up on demo products, but I don't really have a system for automatically refreshing them like I have with games yet. I am working on better demo coverage in future updates.
