A week with interesting contrasts. Devolver Digital's Quarantine Zone launches with a strong concept held back by technical execution, while Super Woden: Rally Edge nails the arcade racing nostalgia with overwhelmingly positive reviews. 
Between them, a mix of games struggling with adaptation issues, localization gaps, and design challenges.

Let's have a look at what launched!

## Quarantine Zone: The Last Check by Brigada Games

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "38408"
}
```

A zombie outbreak strategy simulation game published by Devolver Digital. Players appreciate the community engagement, noting the developers' responsiveness to issues and active involvement with the community.

The game's concept and theme is seen as interesting, though many feel it's not fully realized and it launches at "Mostly Positive".

Biggest criticism by far is the bugs and glitches many players experience with things like softlocks that prevents progression, performance issues.

Despite the issues, the core concept seems to resonate and hopefully they will be able to improve the scores over time. 
There's also an audience anomaly with Simplified Chinese reviews giving the game 50% compared to 75-85% in other areas which brings down the global score.

## Heartopia by XD

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "236029"
}
```

A free to play multiplayer sims/animal crossing-like which seems to lean heavily into a cozy aesthetic - which is appreciated among players. 

However, PC controls and optimization receive heavy criticism - many feel it's poorly adapted for PC.

Monetization is another major complaint. The presence of gacha mechanics and premium content frustrates players in a free-to-play game.

Another big complaint is the use of generative AI, particularly in puzzles AND that the developers were not transparent with it - which rubs a lot of players the wrong way.

## Kotama and Academy Citadel by Atomstring Games

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "217897"
}
```

A 2D action-adventure RPG set in a technologically advanced academy where you control an exchange student navigating a labyrinth filled with traps and enemies.

Character designs are frequently praised for their aesthetic appeal. Combat mechanics receive praise for its fluidity. They also apparently have a "Challenge mode" that is also highly appreciated among players.

On the criticism side, platforming challenges frustrate many players, with complaints about difficulty and mechanics. 
Which seems key to get right for a platformer.

Exploration design receives mixed feelings, particularly regarding hidden areas and map navigation. Boss design also divides players.

## The NOexistenceN of Morphean Paradox : The Forest of Silver Shallots by 0x0Real Studio

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "229828"
}
```

An indie adventure RPG where you lead a guild of adventurers in turn-based combat, which I assume is a sequel to [The NOexistenceN of you AND me](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/153738/the_noexistencen_of_you_and_me).
Players are excited about the return of the character Lilith. The art style and overall presentation receive praise for its beauty and the story is engaging to many.

Technical bugs frequently disrupt, including corrupted saves and UI issues. Save system issues in particular frustrate players. I'm sure those will be worked on during Early Access.

Significant portions of game text remain untranslated from Chinese when players are playing in English.

## Super Woden: Rally Edge by ViJuDa

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "203787"
}
```

A top-down racing game with retro arcade vibes. Launches with overwhelmingly positive reviews.

Graphics and art style receive praise for their nostalgic appeal - brings me back to playing these types of games in the arcade halls just by looking at it.

Players find the game highly replayable due to engaging mechanics and leaderboard challenges. The soundtrack is frequently highlighted as a strong point.

Driving physics spark discussion, with players either finding them satisfying or frustrating.

All in all, a seemingly successful launch.
