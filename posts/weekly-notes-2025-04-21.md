## 🛠️ The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered — Bethesda Game Studios

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "200941"
}
```

Bethesda surprised everyone with the release of *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered*.
When people expected a reveal or teaser, they dropped the game immediately instead.

It’s a move only studios with a massive following can pull off, using their reach to push aggressively across channels. Recently, we’ve seen similar surprise launches with [*RuneScape: Dragonwilds*](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/196566/runescape_dragonwilds) and [*Haste*](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/144454/haste).

Players are thrilled to revisit a classic RPG—nostalgia and the remaster’s improvements are heavily praised. But, as expected, there are considerable complaints about bugs and performance issues.

## 🛠️ Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 — Sandfall Interactive

```condensedgamecard

"gameId": "62059"
}
```

Two days after Bethesda’s surprise, Sandfall Interactive launched *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33*—a more traditional release with reviews, hype-building, and a set date.

I wondered if *Oblivion’s* drop would overshadow them, given the shared RPG space. But they’ve done more than alright—over **1 million copies sold** in under a week and a **90%+ positive rating**.

Players rave about the story, visuals, and combat. Some mention performance issues and frustrations with the combat system, but overall, it's a huge success.

Safe to say—players still love grand single-player RPG experiences.

## 🛠️ The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- — Too Kyo Games & Media.Vision Inc.

```condensedgamecard

Kazutaka Kodaka (creator of the [*Danganronpa* series](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/search?query=Danganronpa)) and Kotaru Uchikoshi (of the [*Zero Escape* series](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/search?query=Zero%20Escape)) teamed up for *The Hundred Line*.

Described as "the ultimate adventure game," it’s sitting at **94% positive**.
Players praise its engaging gameplay, strong characters, and intriguing story, though some note translation issues.

## 🛠️ Early Access Graduates This Week

```condensedgamecard-grid
[
{ "gameId": "63059" },
{ "gameId": "82713" },
{ "gameId": "60962" }
]
```

Several notable games exited Early Access:

- **Dinkum**: Cozy town-building in an Australian-inspired setting. Players enjoy the vibe but mention grindy mechanics.
- **Survivalist: Invisible Strain**: A zombie apocalypse colony sim. Loved for replay value and dev commitment, but some find it brutally difficult.
- **SpellRogue**: A turn-based strategy roguelike. Addictive gameplay, though critiques include translation issues and balancing concerns.

## 🔥 Full List: Top Releases for April 21–27, 2025

*Note: Tempest Rising appears in both this week’s and last week’s lists—likely due to its release timing at the week’s crossover. I’ll adjust this for future recaps.*
