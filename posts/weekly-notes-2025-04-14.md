## 🛠️ RuneScape: Dragonwilds by Jagex

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "196566"
}
```

This week's biggest release by far is *RuneScape: Dragonwilds*. They pulled off a surprise release only two weeks after their first trailer.
Set in the RuneScape universe and leaning on their existing fanbase, it's looking like a big success.

The main critiques are performance and early access issues. A few players mention it doesn't stand out enough, but the majority seem to be having a great time.

A game to keep an eye on.

## 🛠️ Tempest Rising by Slipgate Ironworks

```condensedgamecard

"gameId": "116049"
}
```

As soon as I saw this game it ended up on my wishlist. I used to play *Command & Conquer* (especially *Red Alert 2*) a lot growing up.

Tempest Rising definitely taps into that vibe, and players agree — many highlight the strong nostalgic pull alongside solid gameplay. If you’re a fan of classic RTS games, this is one to watch.

A first-person roguelite speed-climbing game that just hit Early Access. With a 98% positive rating at the time of writing, it’s being praised for its tight controls, addictive loop, and unique retro-inspired art style.

## 🛠️ Last Epoch – Woven Legend Supporter Pack by Eleventh Hour Games

```condensedgamecard

It’s rare to see a DLC top the charts like this, but *Last Epoch* fans are all-in. This supporter pack has over 200 reviews and a perfect 100% rating — players are genuinely happy to support the devs, citing excellent value and appreciation for the game.
