A DLC topping the weekly charts is rare, but Risk of Rain 2's Alloyed Collective pulled it off with Overwhelmingly Positive reviews.

Strong Early Access launches this week too - Cleared Hot brings back Desert Strike nostalgia and Moonlighter 2 returns with roguelike shop-keeping.

Let's dive in!

## Risk of Rain 2: Alloyed Collective by Gearbox Software

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "204026"
}
```

Not that common for a DLC to be at the very top of the list, but the new DLC for Risk of Rain 2 launched with Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. 
Players love the visual and aesthetic design of the new stages, along with creative new items and boss designs. The soundtrack also receives high marks for quality and atmosphere.

The new Operator character is the standout addition - praised for fluid gameplay and unique abilities.

However, another character, Drifter, divides opinion - some find it underwhelming due to its reliance on gimmicks. 
Some technical issues affect multiplayer in particular.

In general, a highly successful DLC. Granted, it's a popular base game, but over 2k reviews for a DLC is quite uncommon from the numbers I've seen.

## Mandate Of Heaven by 木焱工作室

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "229884"
}
```

Localized into a series of languages (although not without complaints), but seemingly catered mainly to a Chinese audience looking at the store page. The Simplified Chinese audience takes up around 97% of all the reviews.

A visual novel type of game which seems to generally do well with chinese players. 

Players are highly impressed with the historical narrative depth. 
Character development receives praise for the depth and complexity of relationships throughout the game.

Also, some concerns arise around QTE mechanics and their execution.

## Cleared Hot by Cfinger Games, Not Knowing Corporation

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "82507"
}
```

A nostalgic helicopter shooter published by MicroProse that evokes fond memories of classics like Desert Strike and Jungle Strike.

Players love the voice acting and dialogue for their quality and humor. 
Helicopter variety and customization options add depth, and the destructible environments is often remarked as a high point.

Some concerns are shown around game length and content available as well as the difficulty balance.

A strong Early Access start!

## Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault by Digital Sun

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "128976"
}
```

The sequel to [Moonlighter](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/176102/moonlighter) launches in Early Access. Players praise the art direction and visual style, along with the soundtrack quality. 
Combat mechanics are seen as improved - smoother and more engaging compared to the first game.

The gameplay loop of fighting by night and selling by day as well as the roguelike elements are appreciated.

Difficulty balance divides opinion, with some finding it too easy - others not.

Performance issues on the Steam Deck in particular are a notable concern, including stuttering and crashes.
Chinese players are notably less positive at around 60% Mixed and interestingly the first game follows that same audience pattern.

## Monsters are Coming! Rock & Road by Ludogram

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "208617"
}
```

A tower-survival roguelite published by [Raw Fury](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/search?query=publisher%3A%22Raw%20Fury%22). Players appreciate the innovative concept of combining tower defense with roguelike elements.

The visual and audio design receive positive feedback, with many enjoying the aesthetic experience.

However, the meta progression system is a major pain point - players find it unbalanced and overly grindy. Balancing issues around enemy strength and tower effectiveness frustrate players.

### Simplified Chinese Audience Anomaly
Since the chinese reviews had such a big difference compared to the global positive sentiment (~70% vs ~40%) - i did a custom snapshot analysis on this game (available to PRO-users!).

They seem to have similar complaints as other audiences, but we also see complaints about the localization. So there might be a combination of issues here.

* [News Tower](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/83942/news_tower) - A management tycoon game. Players love the management aspect of running a newspaper. They love the art style, replayability and soundtrack. It's noted how much it improved during Early Access. Some languages however, get critique for the translation quality being poor.
