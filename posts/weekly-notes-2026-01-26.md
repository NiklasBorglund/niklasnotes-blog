TODO!!

## Highguard by Wildlight Entertainment, Inc.

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "246881"
}
```

Highguard got a messy launch with only a 25% positive on the first day. It was revealed as the final announcement at The Game Awards, which got mixed reactions even then.

Made by industry veterans who worked on titles like Apex Legends, Titanfall and CoD - this is the studio's first game.

Players appreciate the unique gameplay loop that combines looting and combat phases, though opinions vary. 
Game optimization issues dominate the criticism though - unfortunately not uncommon with big profile releases.

Another thing is the 3v3 game mode. Many that the maps are too large to just have 3v3 - but I noticed that the developers are actively listening to feedback and just released [a 5v5 mode](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260?emclan=103582791475413365&emgid=538877446766724427).

## Half Sword by Half Sword Games

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "117609"
}
```

With a demo - you also make a promise that this is what you will get when you buy the finished product.

Half Sword launched with a global rating of 57% - compared to [the playtest with 95% positive](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/180950/half_sword_playtest). A significant drop that tells a story about unmet expectations.

It got an insane amount of wishlists (over 1.6 million [according to their website](https://half-sword.com/)), but the players were expecting to get more of what they got in the demo.
Players noted changes in weapon handling and overall combat feel as well as game content and other features comparing negatively to the previous experience.

Performance optimization issues is also highly mentioned in the criticism - many report severe performance problems, leading to low frame rates and stuttering.

Players do express hope for future improvements and acknowledge the developers' efforts to address issues. And it is an early access game, so let's hope they will iron these issues out over time.

## Cairn by The Game Bakers

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "55612"
}
```

Cairn is also released after a [highly successful demo](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/236573/cairn_demo) released about a year ago. 
This game managed the hype and expectations very well with 94% positive at the time of writing.

It's a realistic climbing simulation where you play as a pro climber, attempting to ascend while managing resources and facing challenges.

Players praise the climbing mechanics as engaging and rewarding, emphasizing the challenge and satisfaction of navigating the mountain.  
Visuals and sound design receive lots of appreciation as well as the survival mechanics integration.

However, performance issues are a concern - several players report technical problems, particularly on the Steam Deck since it's a verified game.

## CODE VEIN II by BANDAI NAMCO Studios Inc.

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "209396"
}
```

A sequel to [CODE VEIN](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/155893/code_vein). Players take on the role of a Revenant hunter, battling monsters and unraveling a time-manipulating story.

And again, as I mentioned above with high profile releases (I feel a bit like a broken record at this point) - the single largest complaint is performance issues. 
Many report severe frame rate issues and stuttering, particularly on mid-range and high-end PCs.

Other than that, it seems to be mixed feelings about a lot of different areas - character customization, story & narrative, combat mechanics compared to the first game.

A follow-up that struggles to meet expectations set by its predecessor.
