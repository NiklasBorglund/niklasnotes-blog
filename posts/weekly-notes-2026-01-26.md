Highguard got a messy launch with only 25% positive on the first day, climbing to 42% Mixed with 34.7K reviews. It was revealed as the final announcement at The Game Awards, which got mixed reactions even then.
Made by industry veterans who worked on titles like Apex Legends, Titanfall and CoD - this is the studio's first game.
Worth noting: 100% of purchases are from outside Steam, suggesting this is available on other platforms or launchers.
Players appreciate the unique gameplay loop that combines looting and combat phases, though opinions vary. However, game optimization issues dominate the criticism - significant performance problems including low FPS and crashes affect gameplay experience.
The 3v3 game mode is a major complaint. Many players feel the 3v3 format is not suitable for the game's large maps, leading to lack of engagement. Community feedback is noted, with players expressing frustration with the community's negative reception and bandwagoning behavior. Visual quality receives criticism, with issues about graphics quality, including blurriness and poor visual fidelity.
A rough launch for a high-profile reveal.
