## Highguard by Wildlight Entertainment, Inc.

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "246881"
}
```

Highguard got a messy launch with only a 25% positive on the first day. It was revealed as the final announcement at The Game Awards, which got mixed reactions even then.

It is made by industry veterans who worked on titles like Apex Legends, Titanfall and CoD and it's the first game of this studio.
