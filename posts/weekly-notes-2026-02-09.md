Mewgenics steals the show this week, recouping its entire development budget in just 3 hours after a 14-year wait since its announcement. 

REANIMAL brings Little Nightmares vibes but faces length-versus-price criticism. 

Starsand Island's gorgeous visuals gets criticism about lack of depth in Early Access. Diablo II's remake runs well on the Steam Deck, but players dislike the mandatory Battle.net account.

Let's dive in!

## Mewgenics by Edmund McMillen & Tyler Glaiel

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "1657"
}
```

Highly anticipated and a highly successful launch from the creator of [The Binding of Isaac](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/82467/the_binding_of_isaac_rebirth) and [Super Meat Boy](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/137366/super_meat_boy).

They earned their entire development budget [back in just 3 hours](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/we-have-made-back-our-development-budget-after-3-hours-mewgenics-explodes-to-number-one-steam-seller-14-years-after-its-announcement/)!

Mewgenics is a tactical game where you breed cats and send them into battle. Players love the cat breeding mechanics and the depth of its systems. Some players find the game pace and grind a bit frustrating due to slow progression.

Launches with an impressive 92% Very Positive at the time of writing and the core gameplay loop seems to really resonate with most players.

One of the most successful launches this year so far.

## REANIMAL by Tarsier Studios

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "39334"
}
```

The latest game from the creators of [Little Nightmares](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/148376/little_nightmares) and [Little Nightmares II](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/79692/little_nightmares_ii). Little Nightmares III was done by another studio named [Supermassive Games](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/developer/Supermassive%20Games).

Continuing on the horror theme, this is a co-op game where you control a brother and sister on a quest to rescue their friends from a hellish island.

They consistently praise the atmospheric design and the game's dark and immersive atmosphere.

Game length is the biggest complaint in the reviews, they often report to have completed it within 3-6 hours. With a price tag of 39.99€ - many feel like this is too high for what they get. A lot of players also report connection issues, lag, bugs and a host of other technical issue.

The audience split is interesting here as well. It consistently gets ~80% positive or more, but the Simplified Chinese audience gives it just 50%. They seem to have similar complaints, but a lot of players complain that there was a delay in the release of the friend pass - I wonder if those complaints were regional.

## Starsand Island by Seed Lab, Creativision Studio and Seed Sparkle Lab

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "108309"
}
```

A casual simulation RPG in Early Access set on a tropical island. I get a bit of Animal Crossing + Stardew Valley vibes from this. Launched with positive reviews overall.

Players consistently praise the game's beautiful graphics and vibrant environments. However, gameplay depth disappoints, lots of players express concerns about lack of engaging gameplay.
It almost seems as if its many different small quirks that gives that overall impression. NPC interaction receives criticism, character design is criticized, resource management frustrates as well as some technical issues on top of that.

The foundation looks good with the visuals to players, but needs work on depth and systems. Things that will be ironed out during early access, I assume.

## Diablo II: Resurrected – Infernal Edition by Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "257161"
}
```

There's something about remakes of classic games that makes me press that wishlist button faster than I can say "Diablo II: Resurrected – Infernal Edition". 
Especially if it's Steam Deck verified.

The Infernal Edition adds a new Warlock class and quality-of-life improvements to the existing gameplay. Nostalgia factor is strong.
Gameplay mechanics remain engaging, including loot systems and character builds. Graphics and visuals are praised.

However, Battle.net account requirement is the biggest complaint. It's required even for single-player gameplay. Server stability issues are also reported including disconnections and lag during gameplay.

## Crisol: Theater of Idols by Vermila Studios

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "733"
}
```

A survival horror adventure set in a nightmarish version of Spain. Players control a soldier who uses his own blood as a weapon while navigating a cursed island.
It got positive reviews overall.

Art direction receives frequent praise for the game's gothic and atmospheric design. The Spanish cultural references are appreciated. 40% of the reviews are marked as Spanish, and the studio who made it is located in Spain.

Apart from various technical issues, there are some issues that are reported. Enemy variety draws concerns about the lack of diversity in enemy design. Pacing issues are mentioned, particularly in the early game. The narrative generates mixed opinions - some like it, some don't.

A solid horror experience with strong atmosphere and a unique blood mechanic, which many report stand out as very unique.
