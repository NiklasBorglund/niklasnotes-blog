Hello everyone!

This week we’ve got a bit of everything: a desert survival epic launching early (but not really), a long-awaited pixel RPG sequel that delivers, and a farming RPG that splits its audience almost perfectly between English and Chinese players.

Let’s dig in.

## Dune: Awakening by Funcom
***Largest audiences**: 67% English Speakers, ~8% Russian, ~6% Chinese (Simplified)*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "127032"
}
```

One of last week's top releases was not even released last week! Not sure what I think of the whole Advanced Access thing, but it's basically a way for games to release their game a bit earlier for more money.

I’ve seen it used only in a handful of cases so far - mostly from big publishers and recognizable IPs like [
Sid Meier's Civilization VII](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/22514/sid_meier_s_civilization_vii)  So I’m guessing it’s not available to every dev out there. Either way, the “real” release of Dune: Awakening is today (June 10), but with over 12,000 reviews already posted last week, we kind of have to talk about it now.

So, is it good?

Turns out, yeah - at least if you care about atmosphere, visuals, and survival gameplay.

The standout feature in the reviews is immersion and beautiful graphics and how much the player loves spending time in the world of Arrakis. Survival mechanics are described as fun and engaging which combined with crafting and building, makes for a well liked gameplay loop.

Server issues were the biggest complaint last week - lots of reviews mention stability or connection problems. Combat is another friction point, with several players describing it as clunky or underdeveloped.

It’ll be interesting to see how the game holds up once it exits Expensive Access - sorry, I meant Advanced Access.

## DELTARUNE by tobyfox
***Largest audiences**: 74% English Speakers, ~6% Russian, ~5% Spanish*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "139989"
}
```

After years of anticipation, Toby Fox released DELTARUNE - the next installment in the [UNDERTALE](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/76059/undertale) series.
It's immediately a smash hit, with 98% positive rating and almost 30k reviews - easily making it one of the top releases the entire month.

It's getting similar praise to its predecessor. Incredible story with an emotional impact, unique gameplay and a soundtrack that players absolutely love.

That said, a few reviewers mention a perceived drop in quality in later chapters, and some frustration around the lack of Chinese language support.

Making a successful, universally acclaimed sequel is not an easy feat - but Toby Fox just pulled it off.

## Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma by Marvelous Inc.
***Largest audiences**: 40% English Speakers, ~39% Chinese (Simplified), ~7% Japanese, ~7% Chinese (Traditional)*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "50979"
}
```

One of the more interesting things about Rune Factory is its nearly even split between English and Chinese-speaking players - around 40% each.

The game mixes simplified farming and town-building with real-time combat and anime-flavored storytelling. That combo is resonating with newcomers, especially those looking for a chill RPG with some light romance and dragon slaying on the side.

Some are enjoying the more streamlined mechanics and quality-of-life features, while others feel the formula has lost depth.

## Lies of P: Overture by NEOWIZ.
***Largest audiences**: 38% English Speakers, ~28% Chinese (Simplified), ~13% Korean*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "172950"
}
```

This DLC prequel to Lies of P received mixed reactions. Players love the boss design and challenge. The story, visuals, and new mechanics also land well.

The DLC is short, and many feel it doesn't justify its price. There’s also a fair bit of criticism around balancing issues, camera problems, and general technical instability.

Interesting audience anomaly: While English and Korean players rate it very positively, Chinese players are far more critical, with a Mixed score of just 58%!

## ⚔️ Early Access Graduates

* [Cyber Knights: Flashpoint](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/74874/cyber_knights_flashpoint) -  Tactical RPG set in a dystopian cyberpunk world where players manage a crew and execute heists. Players love the frequent updates from developers and engaging gameplay - they dislike the visuals and AI behavior.
* [Railroads & Catacombs](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/130194/railroads_catacombs) - Turn-based strategy game set in a dark fantasy world where players manage a train while battling monsters. Players love the gameplay and art style, but have criticism about balance and repetitiveness.
* [GT Manager](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/48767/gt_manager) - A racing team management simulation game. Players like the gameplay and graphics, but some find the mechanics a bit too simple and lacking depth. Another criticism is that it has a mobile game feel over it.
