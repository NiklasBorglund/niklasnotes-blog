We got a lot of releases this week, so I wanted to share a few personal notes on the ones that stood out — along with the full top list at the bottom.

## 🛠️ *Crashlands 2* by Butterscotch Shenanigans

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "86251"
}
```

I haven’t played any of their games yet, but I’ve watched some great GDC talks from this studio.

One I always think about is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQHtOg46eOw) — where they describe developing the first *Crashlands* while one of the founding brothers was battling cancer. Highly recommended.

This sequel seems to be landing well — players are praising the improved mechanics compared to the first game.

## 🌾 *South of Midnight* by Compulsion Games

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "141148"
}
```

This one initially slipped through my release radar (fixed that for next time).

Published by Xbox Game Studios, *South of Midnight* is a third-person action-adventure set in a fantastical version of the American Deep South. It’s sitting at 93% positive at the time of writing — even though some players note the simple combat and linear structure. Doesn’t seem to be a dealbreaker though.

## 🧩 *Blue Prince* by Dogubomb

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "117111"
}
```

There’s been a lot of chatter about this one.

It’s a puzzle game with generally favorable reviews from players — though there’s a noticeable gap between Metacritic critics (92%) and users (81%). The biggest critique? Use of RNG in the puzzles.

## 🎖️ *Commandos: Origins* by Claymore Game Studios

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "77173"
}
```

I remember playing *Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines* back in the day. This new installment taps into that same tactical gameplay.

Fans seem to love the nostalgia — but there’s also criticism around lack of innovation and some lingering bugs.
