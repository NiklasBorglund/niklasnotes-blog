This week didn’t have one giant breakout hit, but we got a little of everything—expansions, remasters, stealthy indies, and word games from YouTubers.

A surprisingly strong lineup if you're the kind of player (or dev) who likes variety over volume.

Let’s take a look.

## Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate by Bungie
***Largest audiences**: ~84% English*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "203198"
}
```

Bungie released their latest DLC named "The Edge of Fate" and the reception is quite mixed.

Negatives dominate: a weak story, the new “matterspark” mechanic called annoying busy-work, and reports of crashes during end-game runs. 
Many feel the QoL tweaks arrived half-baked and the grind outweighs the good.

I used to play Destiny 1 & 2 on the PS4 back in the day. 
I played it basically solo, and I particularly loved the gunplay which made it a great choice to wind down after a long day at work.

Let's see if they can patch the score of this one back to a positive one.

## Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition by FireFly Studios
***Largest audiences**: ~41% English, ~23% German, ~12% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "119918"
}
```
Stronghold Crusader and FireFly Studios seem to be following the Age of Empires playbook—after the [HD version in 2012](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/38653/stronghold_crusader_hd_2012), we now have a definitive edition with modern upgrades.

The fanbase seems happy with the result. At 90 % positive, players praise the nostalgia hit, quality-of-life improvements, updated visuals, and added content.

Main criticisms focus on the multiplayer experience and performance—especially the AI, which many feel still behaves erratically.

## Dungeons & Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition by Aspyr Media
***Largest audiences**: ~58% English, ~23% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "209657"
}
```

I never played any of the Neverwinter Nights games. My brother did, and liked them a lot—so when I saw this, I thought maybe I’d finally try it out myself.

But the launch reception has been rough. Sitting around ~50 % positive, players appreciate that you can now use a controller (it's Deck Verified), enjoy some QoL improvements, and welcome the return of multiplayer mode.

The negativity mostly stems from broken expectations. The camera controls are widely disliked - despite claims of improvement - and the “Enhanced Edition” label got players’ hopes up for more than they received. 
And like with many launches, bugs and performance issues show up in the reviews, but they hit harder when it’s a remaster of an old game.

Managing expectations with your base is tricky - but it’s also crucial.

## Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream by RiverEnd Games
***Largest audiences**: ~45% English, ~13% Chinese(Simplified), ~13% German, ~11% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "88610"
}
```

Eriksholm is made here in Gothenburg, Sweden - where I live and work. I even used to work with some of the talented developers behind it back in the day.

It’s a narrative-heavy, isometric stealth game about uncovering the truth behind the main character’s missing brother.  
And I’m happy to see it doing well - at 93 % positive at the time of writing.

Players praise the excellent visuals, engaging story, and immersive world. Strong voice acting is also frequently mentioned, which I’m personally a sucker for.

The main criticism is that players want more - they feel it’s too short. Maybe another case of mismatched expectations. Based on Niklas Notes data, most players spend around 11 hours on a full playthrough.

## Word Play by Game Maker's Toolkit
***Largest audiences**: ~96% English*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "201234"
}
```

Mark Brown, creator of the popular Game Maker’s Toolkit channel (1.6M subscribers), just released this game.

He also made a great [YouTube video on how it was built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuXrwA9nzM8) - worth a watch if you're into puzzle design.

Word Play is sitting at ~90 % positive and is getting praise for its addictive core loop, clever mechanics, and solid variety.

Some players wish the upgrade system had more depth, but overall it seems to have hit the mark for fans of the genre.

## The Drifter by Dave Lloyd & Powerhoof
***Largest audiences**: ~83% English, ~6% German*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "59841"
}
```

Point & Click.  
A murder mystery.

...and a game filled to the brim with mood and atmosphere. What more could you ask for?

I added this one to my ever-growing wishlist, hoping I’ll find time to play it someday.

Currently sitting at 96 % positive—players love the voice acting, the story, and the absolutely gorgeous pixel art.  
Some mention that the puzzles can get frustrating, and opinions on the game’s length are split: some feel it’s too short, others too long.
