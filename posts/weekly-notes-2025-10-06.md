## Battlefield™ 6 by Battlefield Studios
***Largest audiences**: ~49% English, ~18% Chinese (Simplified), ~8% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "219349"
}
```

Battlefield 6 had a massively successful launch with over 700k concurrent active players at its peak.

Players appreciate the return to classic Battlefield elements - the traditional class system is back and celebrated. 
The optimized gameplay runs smoothly, and the nostalgia factor resonates strongly with series veterans. Gunplay quality receives consistent praise.

However, technical issues persist including bugs and server problems that hinder gameplay.
Map design gets criticized as small and chaotic, often compared to the maps of Call of Duty - saying that smaller maps feel more like CoD than Battlefield.

## Little Nightmares III by Supermassive Games
***Largest audiences**: ~44% English, ~17% Russian, ~15% Chinese (Simplified)*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "157126"
}
```

The horror series returns with co-op gameplay, but at 45% Mixed - which is significantly lower than both [Little Nightmares](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/148376/little_nightmares) and [Little Nightmares II](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/79692/little_nightmares_ii).

Some praise the atmosphere, visuals, sound design, and graphics quality. The co-op gameplay works when playing with friends.

However, significant gameplay bugs hinder the experience, including soft locks and unresponsive companion AI. The game is criticized for being extremely short (often completed in just a few hours). Many feel it lacks innovation and doesn't live up to its predecessors.
Many also criticize the lack of local co-op.

In my opinion, taking a solo experience with a big following and making it multiplayer is a **bold** move. Players who play strong solo experiences tend to want to play just that - strong solo experiences.
I wonder if that was one part in the low reception of this title among its many issues.

## Absolum by Dotemu, Guard Crush, Supamonks
***Largest audiences**: ~50% English, ~16% Chinese (Simplified), ~11% Russian*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "186762"
}
```

A side-scrolling action RPG set in fantasy world where players praise the engaging gameplay with fun, addictive combat mechanics and roguelite elements.
The smooth combat system feels fluid and satisfying. High replay value keeps players coming back and the cooperative gameplay shines when played with friends.

Minor criticisms include lack of content depth, with some wanting more to enhance the experience. Combat difficulty frustrates some players regarding attack animations and enemy interactions.

The ~9-hour median playtime suggests a solid experience of beat 'em up and roguelite mechanics.

## CARIMARA: Beneath the forlorn limbs by Bastinus Rex
***Largest audiences**: ~40% English, ~18% Russian, ~12% French*

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "194228"
}
```

A narrative-driven game where players embody a mute character named Carimara, exploring a house where you only can use your gift of conjuring questions.

Players praise the unique art style and atmospheric experience that immerses them in this eerie and whimsical world. The engaging story captivates emotionally, with several reviews highlighting the emotional depth.

The main criticism is the extremely short playtime - at under 2 hours estimated completion time. A memorable indie title that resonates with its audience, though some wish there was more of it.

***Largest audiences**: ~38% English, ~37% Russian, ~6% Chinese (Simplified), ~6% Polish*
