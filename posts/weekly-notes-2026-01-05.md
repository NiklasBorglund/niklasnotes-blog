The first "real" week after the Steam Winter Sale offered a few interesting releases.  We saw Creepy Jar execute a clever cross-promotion strategy with Green Hell to boost StarRupture's launch, Pathologic 3 divide its fanbase with significant gameplay changes, and a couple of smaller titles nail their execution with clear visions.

Let's dive in!

## StarRupture by Creepy Jar

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "184515"
}
```

First off, we have StarRupture - a multiplayer survival game from the makers of [Green Hell](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/11643/green_hell).

And it seems like they had an interesting tactic and launched a developer sale in preparation for the launch. Overlapping the Steam Winter Sale and still ongoing with a 90% discount of their previous title Green Hell.
It was even a "Featured Deep Discount" during the sale, and it seems to have paid off in attention. 

Green Hell got a review spike with thousands of new reviews.

And with solid cross promotion strategy, StarRupture got a nice 4k amount of reviews the first week.

Players appreciate the core gameplay mechanics, particularly the factory building and automation aspects. Graphics and visual performance receive praise, with many finding it visually appealing. However, Early Access concerns dominate the criticism. Many reviews highlight bugs, incomplete features, and the expectation that significant work remains.

The Simplified Chinese audience shows notably lower sentiment at 51% Mixed compared to 84-93% in other regions. I did a quick custom report, and it doesn't seem to be localization issues - but more the same issues but judged more harshly.

## Vital Shell by MarvinWizard

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "208571"
}
```

The game launches with an impressive 99% positive score. A single-player top-down arena shooter where you control mechs that looks like it was made for the Playstation 1 (in a good way!).
Players frequently praise the aesthetics and it invokes lots of nostalgia for classic games.

The soundtrack also receives high praise, often described as nostalgic and fitting. Gameplay mechanics are well-received, with players appreciating the engaging combat that includes unique synergies and resource management.
With such a high score, most of it gets praised - which is usually a sign of perfectly managed expectations towards the players.

With an estimated playthrough of ~5 hours and 10% of reviews from Steam Deck players, it seems to be placing itself in a nice place for a short and sweet experience high in nostalgia.

## Pathologic 3 by Ice-Pick Lodge

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "152142"
}
```

In Pathologic 3, you play as a physician with 12 days to save a town from a plague while dealing with the consequences of your past mistakes.
Players praise the technical optimization, noting smooth performance and high graphical fidelity. 

Character development receives appreciation, particularly for the depth and complexity of the new protagonist.

The biggest criticism centers on gameplay mechanics simplification, particularly the removal of survival elements that defined previous titles (like [Pathologic 2](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/173579/pathologic_2)).
Players note a significant shift towards narrative and story at the expense of gameplay mechanics compared to earlier games.

A few game mechanics choices also spark a lot of discussion - like the time travel mechanics. Some like it, some don't. 

Reception is clearly divided between fans embracing the changes and those wanting more of the previous games. Expectations is a tricky thing to manage when developing sequels.

## ODDCORE by ODDCORP & Scarecrow Arts

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "149411"
}
```

This game also has an interesting aesthetic - it's a fast-paced retro "liminal" styled FPS. It's often praised in the reviews as unique and creates a surreal atmosphere.

The gameplay mechanics receive strong praise, with players enjoying the fast-paced action and roguelite elements involving time management and souls.
Replayability is frequently mentioned as a strength due to the game's mechanics. However, the estimated playthrough on this site is just around 6 hours so far, so the reviewers haven't spent that much time in the game (yet?).

On the criticism side, difficulty spikes and balance issues are the main concern, with players expressing frustration about the game's difficulty and need for better scaling. Some feel the game lacks challenge overall.
