This week's releases were understandably slow since Steam had their Autumn Sale - and like during all the big sales, developers generally hold off with new releases.

On a personal note, I just became a father for the second time two days ago to the most amazing little baby boy :)  So I will not do any commentary like I usually do this week.

But I still want to give a quick update on what was released.
Enjoy!
