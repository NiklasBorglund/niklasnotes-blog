Another slow week because of holiday, winter sale and new year season. But the Steam Awards just concluded, so I thought we could check those out instead.

And since it's a new month (and year), there's the full list of the most popular games in December 2025 at the bottom.

Let's check out the winners!

---

## Game of the Year Award

### Winner: Hollow Knight: Silksong by Team Cherry

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "39445"
}
```

One of the most anticipated releases of the year even broke Steam at its launch and accumulated a whopping 100k reviews already in the first week.
It had a controversy around its Chinese Translation being incredibly archaic and hard to follow - which I covered in my [weekly notes when it was released](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/blog/weekly-notes-2025-09-01).

However, they seem to have fixed the issues since. The score with the Simplified Chinese Audience has improved from 56% to ~80-90%.
The image is from the review timeline - available to all Pro Members.

A lot of good games released this year, so it had tough competition!

## VR Game of the Year Award

### Winner: The Midnight Walk by MoonHood

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "94583"
}
```

Made here in Gothenburg! This beautiful claymation game keeps getting high scores since release.

It even got [picked up for film and TV adaptations](https://www.polygon.com/news/605968/midnight-walk-tv-film-adaptation-story-kitchen/). Will be interesting to see how it will turn out.

The other contenders are quite the mix. Funny, I never realized that racing games could be contenders for VR awards. 
I imagine motion sickness would be a thing, but I guess not!

### Nominees

["125355", "150463", "195686", "6835"]
```

## Labor of Love Award

### Winner: Baldur's Gate 3 by Larian Studios

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "1958"
}
```

I love this game. Such an incredible masterpiece, and I can't wait for [the next Divinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz5lWeGhq2o).

In my opinion, very well deserved award. I completed this journey with my wife this summer, and I wrote this piece back then:

---
*My wife, a warlock.*

*Me? I was a 200 year old vampire.* 

*With worms firmly lodged in our brains, we went on to save the world.*
*We started over a year ago playing Baldur's Gate 3 together, instead of watching movies - we opted to go into this adventure.* 

*It took us almost 180 hours in total, and we have so many stories from our adventure. We investigated plots, found companions and explored a new world. We even traveled to hell and back, literally, to tear up a devil’s contract with our own hands.* 

*Experiences like that are a big part of why I make games.*

*Thank you Larian Studios. I can’t wait to see what you do next.*

Highly recommended.

## Best Game on Steam Deck Award

### Winner: Hades II by Supergiant Games

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "6726"
}
```

Hades II had a massively successful 1.0 release after little over a year in Early Access.

If we check the review timeline, we could see a massive review spike during the time of release. 

![HadesReviewTimeline](./hades_ii_review_timeline.png)

Also, we can see that around 5% of the reviews are from Steam Deck players - which is generally high. 
In my experience, most games are under 3% if they are popular.

## Better With Friends Award

### Winner: PEAK by Landfall, Aggro Crab, Landcrab & Team PEAK

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "210519"
}
```

Landfall should be interviewed and studied on how to make a viral hit, they sure have some form of recipe for it with hits like [TABS](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/176335/totally_accurate_battle_simulator), [ROUNDS](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/2824/rounds) & [Clustertruck](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/51325/clustertruck).

This game was probably an insanely larger hit than they expected. I tried it with my colleagues and I had great fun. The proximity chat worked brilliantly to create humorous situations.

It also feels like this started a wave of new "friendslop" games on Steam (a term I dislike, I don't think there's anything 'slop' about PEAK).

### Nominees

```minigamecardlist
["61387", "164550", "72681", "219349"]
```

## Outstanding Visual Style Award

### Winner: SILENT HILL f by NeoBards Entertainment Ltd.

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "188298"
}
```

Psychological horror game set in 1960s Japan. Looking at the reviews it's highly praised for its atmospheric design.
Looking at the screenshots, it does look very good. A significant amount of players seems to have complaints about the combat mechanics though.

### Nominees

```minigamecardlist
["30362", "125391", "86345", "183324"]
```

## Most Innovative Gameplay Award

### Winner: ARC Raiders by Embark Studios

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "86681"
}
```

Another Swedish game, created by Embark Studios. This was also a mega hit when it was released just a few months ago.

While the game is very well received, a lot of reviews discuss the PvP experience as something that detracts the enjoyment along with the extraction mechanics (particularly around camping).

### Nominees

```minigamecardlist
["203750", "203886", "38555", "117111"]
```

---

## Best Game You Suck At Award

### Winner: Hollow Knight: Silksong by Team Cherry

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "39445"
}
```

Silksong got another award! I've heard a lot of people finding it difficult (in a good way).

### Nominees

```minigamecardlist
["197637", "8794", "98557", "139190"]
```

---

## Best Soundtrack Award

### Winner: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 by Sandfall Interactive

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "62059"
}
```

If I had to guess, I would expect Clair Obscur to take home more awards given how many it got at [The Game Awards](https://thegameawards.com/winners/game-of-the-year).

But Best Soundtrack is an honorable award! I love game soundtracks and I routinely listen to soundtracks of games I haven't even played. So I will definitely check this one out (and all the other nominees!).

### Nominees

```minigamecardlist
["139989", "183357", "42803", "46994"]
```

---

## Outstanding Story-Rich Game Award

### Winner: Dispatch by AdHoc Studio

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "82330"
}
```

Dispatch put episodic content back on the map, although it was a major point of critique in the reviews. 
Players love the voice acting (with a [star-studded cast](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt34996965/fullcredits/)), the writing quality and the humorous story.

Niklas Notes estimates the playthrough time to be around 10 hours and with over 150k reviews it has an impressive 97% positive score at the time of writing.

### Nominees

```minigamecardlist
["154625", "143153", "58360", "105146"]
```

## Sit Back and Relax Award

### RV There Yet? by NUGGETS ENTERTAINMENT

```condensedgamecard
{
"gameId": "235439"
}
```

Also made in one of the gamedev capitals of Sweden - Skövde! A game jam game that [was completed in just 8 weeks!](https://skovde.com/en/rvthereyet/#).

It has some technical issues and buggy physics that people complain about in the reviews, but that seems to be nothing that changes the score. 
It has 91% positive and has sold over 2.5 million copies so far.

I get the feeling that the success of PEAK inspired them to do this, and it takes guts to pivot and pause the development of [their other game](https://niklasnotes.com/dashboard/game/33828/among_the_wild). 
Doesn't always work, but this time I assume that they are very happy about that!

## Closing Thoughts

My main takeaway and question after going through this is - Did Sweden win the Steam Awards 2025?

4 of the winners were developed in Sweden:

- The Midnight Walk
- PEAK
- ARC Raiders
- RV There Yet?

And out of the nominees we had quite a few as well:

- Helldivers 2
- Split Fiction
- R.E.P.O
- Battlefield 6
- Europa Universalis V (At least published, Paradox Tinto seems to be Spanish based. But it's Paradox - so I'll count it)
- Blue Prince (Published by Raw Fury)

So yeah, I guess Sweden won! ;)
